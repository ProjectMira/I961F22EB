Second, the explanation of the Sixth Ground (bhūmi) called "Manifest" has four parts: 1) The definitive terminology of the ground and special teaching on transcendent wisdom (prajñāpāramitā); 2) Praise of the perfection of wisdom; 3) Explanation of the true nature through the view of profound dependent origination; and 4) Conclusion through expressing the qualities of this ground.
First, having attained complete perfection of the concentration paramita at the fifth ground, one faces or enters the sixth ground, dwelling in an exceptional state of meditative equipoise. Based on that, the bodhisattva dwelling on the sixth ground sees the profound suchness of dependent origination, which is merely this conditionality. Through dwelling in the exceptional perfection of wisdom, they attain cessation. Prior to this, on the fifth ground and below, cessation is not attained because there is no exceptional superiority of the perfection of wisdom. The mere perfection of the first five paramitas like generosity and so forth is not sufficient to attain cessation.
Due to directly realizing the nature of phenomena as being like reflections through superior wisdom, due to focusing on the truth of the path at the fifth ground, and due to directly orienting towards attaining the qualities of a fully enlightened Buddha, this ground is called "The Manifest."
Regarding the meaning of the second reason, although the commentary explains it as the direct realization of the path where neither consciousness nor objects of knowledge are observed, since the focus on the truth of the path in the fifth ground is mentioned as the last of the Four Noble Truths, one attains mastery in both the coarse and subtle aspects of the Four Noble Truths there. Therefore, in the sixth ground, it means the perfection of wisdom that is skilled in the Four Noble Truths. The first reason shows the completion of the training in wisdom that is skilled in both forward and reverse dependent origination. Through the completion of these two aspects of wisdom training, one directly realizes both the truths and dependent origination.
Thus, on this ground, the three trainings of wisdom are completed, and to whatever degree calm abiding (shamatha) is enhanced, insight (vipashyana) is enhanced to that same degree. On the fifth ground, having attained the perfection of meditation (dhyana paramita), based on that, here the perfection of wisdom (prajna paramita) becomes supreme. Therefore, from this point onwards, one attains the unique ability to enter into the meditative absorption of cessation.
From the Precious Garland: "The sixth is called 'Facing Directly,' because of directly facing the Buddha's teachings. Through familiarization with calm abiding and special insight, one attains cessation and thus develops. Due to the ripening of this, one becomes Sunirmita (the king of gods who delights in emanations). Because they cannot be outshone by hearers, they pacify those with excessive pride."
Second, to show that collections of practices like generosity and others, apart from wisdom (prajñā), depend on wisdom to progress to the resultant state, it is explained:$$Just as a person with sight can easily guide an entire group of blind people to their desired destination, similarly, in this context of the path, wisdom (prajñā) takes hold of qualities like generosity and others that lack the eye of true vision, and leads them to the state of enlightenment. This is because wisdom correctly sees both the authentic path and what is not the path, without confusion.
From the Noble Compendium (Ārya-saṃcaya): "How can millions and billions of blind people without a guide know the path, let alone enter the city? Without wisdom, these five perfections are like being without eyes; without a guide, they cannot reach enlightenment."$$And from the Diamond Cutter (Vajracchedikā): "For example, just as a person with eyes entering darkness cannot see anything, so should one view a bodhisattva who practices giving while falling into [the conception of] real entities. Subhūti, it is like this: just as a person with eyes sees various forms when dawn breaks and the sun rises, likewise should one view a bodhisattva who practices giving without falling into [the conception of] real entities."$$This applies similarly to moral discipline and the other [perfections] as well.
The third section has five parts: 1) The commitment to explain the profound meaning, 2) Identifying the proper vessel (student) for explaining the profound meaning, 3) How benefits arise when explaining to them, 4) Encouraging qualified individuals to listen, and 5) The method of explaining the true nature of dependent origination.
First, regarding how one sees dependent origination at the sixth ground, if asked "How does one see the true nature of 'this arises in dependence on that'?", the commentary responds: Its true nature is not within the scope of those like us whose mind's eye is completely covered by the thick cataract of ignorance. Rather, it becomes the domain of those dwelling on the sixth and higher grounds. Therefore, this is not a question for us to answer, but should be addressed to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas whose mind's eye, anointed with the eye medicine of correctly seeing emptiness which destroys the cataract of ignorance, is free from the film of ignorance.
When asking about the realization of ultimate reality, the teacher instructs to ask those [who have realized it]. Just as applying eye medicine clarifies vision rather than removing the eye, applying the eye medicine of seeing emptiness clarifies the eye of wisdom rather than removing the eye of primordial wisdom. Understanding this, one will not be tainted by the wrong view that denies the existence of wisdom in noble beings' meditative equipoise. If one asks: "Don't the Prajnaparamita Sutras and the Dashabhumika Sutra teach that Bodhisattvas practicing the perfection of wisdom see the true nature of dependent origination? Therefore, shouldn't we explain according to these scriptures?" [The response is:] Since it is difficult even to ascertain the intended meaning of scriptures, those like us cannot teach ultimate reality even through scripture.
Speaking independently, it is stated thus: Through seeing the authentic teachings of treatises composed by realized beings who have become valid authorities in explaining ultimate reality, and their unmistaken explanation of scripture, one can ascertain the intended meaning of scripture. Just as the one on the sixth ground realized the extremely profound Dharma, Noble Nagarjuna, having perfectly understood the unmistaken meaning of scripture, clearly taught the ultimate nature of phenomena not only through scriptural citations in his Madhyamaka treatises, but also through reasoning. Therefore, just as the ultimate reality was taught in Noble Nagarjuna's texts, Chandrakirti will explain exactly according to the system established by Nagarjuna.
If one asks how Ārya Nāgārjuna had definitive understanding of the meaning of the definitive scriptures without error, it is known from scripture. As stated in the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra:$$"In the southern region of Vidarbha,$There will be a renowned and glorious monk,$Known by the name 'Nāga',$Who will destroy the extremes of existence and non-existence.$Having explained in the world my vehicle,$The unsurpassed Mahāyāna,$He will attain the First Ground of Perfect Joy,$And then proceed to Sukhāvatī."$$Thus it is taught that Nāgārjuna would comment on the definitive vehicle that is free from the two extremes of existence and non-existence.
This is explained in the Golden Light Sutra: The Licchavi youth known as "Delightful to All Who See Him" who lived during the Teacher's time was reborn [as Nāgārjuna]. As stated in the Mahāmegha Sutra: "Four hundred years after my passing into nirvana, this youth will become a monk named Nāga and will spread my teachings extensively. Finally, in a pure realm called 'Radiantly Pure Light,' he will become a Buddha named 'Luminous Source of Wisdom.'" Thus it is said. Therefore, it is established that there exists a definitive, unerring prophetic statement about him.
From the Root Tantra of Manjushri, it is said that the time of his appearance and characteristics were similar, and he lived for six hundred years. According to the Drum Sutra, the young Licchavi who was beloved by all worlds, eighty years after the Teacher's passing when the doctrine was declining, became a monk bearing the Teacher's name and caused the doctrine to flourish. It is said that after living for one hundred years, he passed away and was reborn in Sukhavati (Pure Land). The great elder Changzang and Lord Atisha maintain that this prophecy refers to this master, based on explanations that the beloved Licchavi and Nagarjuna were of the same lineage. The Drum Sutra describes this monk as having attained the seventh ground (bhumi). These various accounts cannot be proven contradictory, because in the scriptures there are many instances where some texts describe certain great kings as Stream-enterers while other texts describe them as Buddhas.
Secondly, these definitive treatises should only be taught to those who have previously cultivated familiarity and in whom seeds of understanding emptiness have been planted. They should not be taught to others because even if such people listen to texts teaching emptiness, since they possess wrong views about emptiness, they will encounter great misfortune.
The way great harm occurs is this: Sometimes the unwise reject emptiness and go to lower realms. Sometimes, they mistakenly grasp the meaning of emptiness (which is the lack of inherent existence) as meaning "these phenomena do not exist at all and are non-existent." First, they develop wrong views that deny all causality and effects. Then, without abandoning this view, they make it grow stronger and stronger.
If emptiness is misunderstood,$Those of little wisdom will be destroyed,$Just like wrongly grasping a snake,$Or incorrectly practicing mantras.$$As explained in the Clear Words Commentary: To avoid falling into the extreme of denying conventional reality, one must not harm the cause-and-effect relationship that is like a reflection. To avoid falling into the extreme of exaggerating ultimate reality, one must see cause and effect in things that are precisely without inherent nature. Deviating from these two leads to falling into the extremes of eternalism and nihilism. It is taught that considering conditioned phenomena as non-existent is a wrong view. Although there may be verbal distinctions between "non-existent" and "not existent," when one carefully examines the mental appearance of non-existence, there is no difference whatsoever.
From the Four Hundred Verses (Catuhsataka): "One goes to lower realms, while the ordinary goes to peace."$$In its commentary: Those who are not noble beings and who hear the teachings on selflessness will go only to lower realms due to rejection and wrong understanding. Thus, both types go to lower realms. Wrong understanding here means grasping emptiness as meaning non-existence.$$Therefore, while lacking the mental capacity to discern extremely subtle meanings, those with pride who think they understand, and who develop strong apparent devotion merely to the words of profound meaning that don't match their faculties, will bring great harm to themselves. Thus, one should be very careful regarding these matters. Furthermore, one should consider how appropriate it is to teach emptiness to such a person.
How can one determine with certainty to whom emptiness should not be taught? This can be determined through external signs, as follows: When an ordinary beginner first hears the unmistaken teachings on emptiness, and upon hearing it, they repeatedly experience intense joy within, and from that joy tears moisten their eyes and their body hair stands on end - such a person possesses what is called the seed of the Buddha's non-conceptual wisdom, the seed for realizing emptiness. Such a person is the proper vessel for receiving teachings on ultimate reality from a skilled master. To such a person, the ultimate truth possessing the characteristics that will be explained should be taught.
When one hears the unerring teachings of emptiness and understands them, and these two conditions combine to produce physical signs, this is an unmistaken indication. However, if one either does not understand the meaning, or understands it but these signs do not arise, then although one cannot yet be definitively considered a vessel for the profound teachings, if one does not transgress the instructions of the holy guru, one can still become a suitable vessel for newly establishing many potentials for realizing emptiness.
Third, teaching emptiness to the aforementioned listener will not be fruitless. Why is this so? Not only will this listener not develop wrong views and misconceptions about emptiness through incorrect understanding, but also the qualities of the result that follow from listening to the view of emptiness will arise.
How does it arise? The suitable vessel, viewing the hearing of emptiness teachings as similar to finding a treasure, and in order to prevent the deterioration of this view in future lives, constantly maintains proper moral discipline. This is because they think: "If I fall into lower realms due to breaking moral discipline, my view of emptiness will naturally be interrupted." Thus, they take up moral discipline and protect it without deterioration.$$For those who break moral discipline, there's no need to have previously taken moral vows; naturally harmful actions that oppose moral discipline are themselves a breach of ethics. Even if one is reborn in higher realms due to maintaining moral discipline, if one becomes poor and lacks necessities like food, drink, medicine, clothing and other life essentials, one might become preoccupied with seeking these things, thereby interrupting the hearing and meditation on the view of emptiness. Therefore, as explained before, they engage in giving to both superior and inferior fields of merit.
The view of emptiness held together with great compassion as previously explained leads to Buddhahood, and not otherwise. Thinking thus, one cultivates familiarity with great compassion as the root. Anger leads to rebirth in lower realms and destroys virtue, and causes one to obtain an extremely ugly appearance. Thinking that due to these conditions one will not please the noble ones, one practices patience. Morality and other virtues that are not repeatedly dedicated to omniscience will not become uninterrupted causes for attaining Buddhahood and will not bring forth endless fruits such as body and enjoyments. Therefore, one completely dedicates those virtues of morality and so forth toward enlightenment in order to liberate beings from samsara.
Seeing that others, except for Bodhisattvas, such as Shravakas and Pratyekabuddhas, cannot teach the profound dependent origination like Bodhisattvas can, one develops deep respect for the perfect Bodhisattvas. For Mahayana practitioners who have genuinely understood the view of emptiness, such pure understanding as explained before arises, and they develop great reverence for practicing the vast aspects. This is highly praiseworthy, as stated in the Bodhichittavivarana: "Having understood the emptiness of phenomena, those who still rely on karma and its effects - this is more wonderful than the wonderful, more marvelous than the marvelous." This means avoiding two flaws: rejecting due to lack of faith as an improper vessel, and appearing to have faith while misunderstanding that reasoning negates all cause and effect. Instead, based precisely on the view of emptiness - the lack of inherent existence - one comes to understand that all activities and functions are entirely valid.
If this is not the case, when following the system of having found the view, all the frameworks of karma and its results, such as moral discipline, become like counting the wrinkles on a rabbit's horn. Such [teachings] are for those who haven't understood the definitive meaning, but are unnecessary for those who have understood the definitive meaning. This is because all these are created by conceptual thought, and all conceptual thoughts are grasping at characteristics with belief in their truth. Holding such a view destroys all virtue, just like the Chinese Hashang.
Some say that temporarily one should practice acceptance and rejection from the perspective of delusion. However, if one makes a distinction between thoughts that grasp at true existence and those that don't, then it becomes nonsensical to negate all objects through reasoning that refutes inherent existence. And if one doesn't make this distinction, then the conceptual thoughts of view and conduct become like hot and cold opposing each other, causing mutual harm. Moreover, since there is no basis for establishing the deluded perspective, the one who establishes it, and what is to be established there, speaking in such a way is like creating illusions in darkness. Therefore, this position holds to the earlier mentioned opposing view in those texts.
Fourth: Thus, as explained above, those wise beings who are skilled in the profound and vast methods will, over a long period of time and without interruption, definitely accumulate collections of virtue in both profound and vast aspects while in the ordinary being's stage. They will gradually attain the First Ground of Perfect Joy. Therefore, those who aspire to reach that Ground of Perfect Joy should listen to this profound path that will be explained - thus encouraging listeners to pay attention.
Furthermore, from the Commentary on the Four Hundred Verses: If one becomes respectful of the teaching of emptiness of inherent existence, then one should act in such a way as to increase faith in emptiness by establishing concordant conditions. With great compassion and gratitude toward the Blessed One, the Tathagata, and wishing to completely abandon the causes of obstacles to one's own holy Dharma which are the causes of great peril, one should rely on the fearsome, give what is difficult to give, and gather through the four means of gathering. This holy Dharma should be taught with all effort to those who are proper vessels for the holy Dharma. As stated thus, this Dharma must be taught with great effort to those who are free from the two faults of being improper vessels. Even to those who have faith but do not understand exactly as it is, it should be explained using methods that do not contradict the certainty of dependent origination.
When one who understands well teaches to suitable listeners, even of the lowest capacity, it generates immense merit. As stated in the Sūtrasamuccaya: "Having faith in the profound Dharma encompasses all merit. Until one attains Buddhahood, all worldly and transcendent excellences will be accomplished." As mentioned in the Sūtra Given by the Precious Youth: "Mañjuśrī, compared to a bodhisattva who lacks skillful means practicing the six perfections for hundreds of thousands of eons, one who listens to this Dharma discourse even with doubt generates far greater merit. What need to mention those who listen without doubt? And what need to mention those who write it down, recite it, maintain it, and extensively teach it to others?"
From the Vajra Cutter (Diamond Sutra): The Blessed One spoke: "Subhuti, what do you think? If there were as many Ganges Rivers as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, would the grains of sand in all those rivers be many?" Subhuti replied, "Blessed One, even that many Ganges Rivers alone would be many, let alone the grains of sand in them." The Blessed One said, "Subhuti, I declare this to you, you should understand this: If a man or woman were to fill as many world systems as there are grains of sand in all those Ganges Rivers with the seven precious substances and offer them to the Tathagata, would that man or woman generate much merit from that basis?" Subhuti replied, "Blessed One, it would be much. Sugata, it would be much."
The Blessed One declared: "Whoever retains even just a four-line verse from this Dharma discourse and teaches it to others generates far greater merit."$$And from the Sutra of the Tathagata's Treasury, after enumerating the ten great non-virtues, it states: "Even those who possess these [non-virtues], if they enter into the teachings of selflessness and have faith and devotion in understanding that all phenomena are primordially pure, such beings will not go to the lower realms."$$From the Chapter on Subduing Mara: "When a monk understands that all phenomena are thoroughly tamed and knows that even the initial root of misdeeds is naturally empty, and does not become firmly caught in regret over misdeeds that have occurred, they can overcome even the most heinous acts - let alone minor infractions of ritual procedures and moral discipline."$$From the Ajatashatru Sutra: "When those who have committed the most heinous acts hear this sublime Dharma and enter into it with devotion, I do not say that those actions constitute karmic obscurations."$$These passages illustrate the benefits of teaching, listening to, and otherwise contemplating and having devotion to the profound meaning.
To properly obtain the benefits of teaching, two things are necessary: a pure motivation that does not look to gain, honor, or fame, and an explanation of the Dharma that is not mistaken but correctly understood. If one teaches while possessing either or both of these faults, it is said to create obstacles to accumulating great merit. As Master Vasubandhu stated: "Therefore, those who teach the Dharma incorrectly and teach with minds afflicted by desire for gain, honor and fame are destroying their own great merit." This applies here as well.$$For listeners too, it is important to have pure motivation for listening and to not misunderstand the meaning. Therefore, both teachers and students should possess at least the minimum qualities during teaching and listening sessions.$$The fifth section has three parts: the way of showing the authentic meaning through scripture, establishing that scriptural meaning through reasoning, and explaining the classifications of emptiness thus established. The first has two parts: presenting how it is taught in scripture and identifying the opposing factors to understanding suchness.
From the Tenth Bhumi, it states: When entering the sixth bhumi from the fifth bhumi, one enters through ten kinds of sameness of dharmas. What are these ten? They are:$$1. The sameness of all dharmas being without characteristics$2. The sameness of all dharmas being without defining marks$3. Similarly, the sameness of being unborn$4. The sameness of being non-arising$5. The sameness of being isolated$6. The sameness of being primordially pure$7. The sameness of being without elaboration$8. The sameness of being without acceptance or rejection$9. The sameness of all dharmas being like illusions, dreams, mirages, echoes, moon reflections in water, reflections, and magical creations$10. The sameness of all dharmas being beyond the duality of existence and non-existence$$When one thoroughly realizes the nature of all phenomena in this way, through sharp and concordant patience, one attains the manifest sixth bhumi of bodhisattvas. The phrase "similarly" applies to "all dharmas" up through "without acceptance or rejection." The first two constitute one sameness, the seven similies (illusion etc.) constitute one sameness, and the final two also constitute one. Regarding the identification of these ten samenesses, there appear to be disagreements between the Dashabhumika Sutra commentary and the Bodhisattvabhumi. Since their interpretations of emptiness differ from this system, it is explained differently here. The first sameness means that all dharmas are equal in that their apparently different characteristics do not exist from the perspective of noble beings' meditative equipoise.
Second, all phenomena are equal in that they do not exist through their own characteristics. These two present the general teaching. The other eight show this general meaning by breaking it down into specifics. 'Non-arising' refers to the future, and 'unborn' refers to other times. This equality or similarity applies to all phenomena and should be understood for the others as well. 'Isolation' means emptiness of what will arise and what has arisen, and this isolation is specifically characterized by its own characteristics as discussed in the second equality. Such a state is not artificially created by scripture and reasoning but exists as primordially pure - this is the sixth. The seventh has two aspects: the absence of dualistic elaborations relates to the first, while the inability to be elaborated by words and concepts relates to the second aspect. The eighth should be applied with these same distinctions. The ninth consists of many examples that establish these previously explained meanings. The tenth shows how all phenomena are equal in that they lack inherent existence as either entities or non-entities. 'Sharp' refers to swift wisdom. 'Concordant' means accordance with the patience regarding the unborn nature of phenomena at the eighth ground. This concordant patience appears in many different forms depending on context. Although there are many scriptures teaching the true nature of phenomena, here, since this section explains how wisdom at the sixth ground realizes suchness, it quotes the scripture teaching the ten equalities of the sixth ground.
Second, regarding establishing phenomena as lacking true existence: if one does not properly understand what true existence means and how it is grasped as true, one will definitely miss the view of suchness. As stated in the Bodhicaryavatara: "Without touching upon the investigated object, one cannot grasp its non-existence." This means that if the investigated object - the general object to be negated - is not clearly present in one's mind, one cannot properly grasp its non-existence. Therefore, if one does not clearly understand in their mind both what true existence (which is to be negated) is and what is the aspect of the object to be negated (of which things are empty), it is impossible to properly ascertain emptiness and the nature of lacking true existence.$$Moreover, it is not sufficient to merely identify the philosophically imputed true existence and grasping at true existence as asserted by philosophical schools. It is crucially important to properly identify the innate grasping at true existence that has existed since beginningless time in both those whose minds have and have not been influenced by philosophical schools, as well as the true existence that is grasped by it. Without identifying this, even if one negates the object of negation through reasoning, it will not affect the belief in true existence that has existed since beginningless time, thus missing the point.$$Furthermore, one must first identify the grasping at true existence in one's own mindstream, and then understand how the various reasonings directly and indirectly work to refute its object. Mere outward-directed debate and analysis has very little benefit. If one understands how both the Prasangika and Svatantrika Madhyamaka systems identify these, one will be able to distinguish their differences well. This explanation has two parts: identifying grasping at true existence according to the Svatantrika Madhyamaka system and identifying it according to the Prasangika Madhyamaka system. The first has three parts: identifying true existence and grasping at true existence, explaining true and false in relation to worldly convention through the example of illusion, and applying this example to explain the meaning.
First, in other authoritative Svatantrika texts, the identification of what is to be negated is not clearly stated. From the Madhyamakaloka, understanding that the opposite of how things exist conventionally is their ultimate or truly existent nature, it states:$$"That deluded mind which superimposes existence onto phenomena that are ultimately without inherent nature is called 'conventional.' It is called so because it obscures or covers the true nature of reality. As stated in the sutra:$$'The arising of things is conventional,$In ultimate truth they lack inherent nature.$The delusion regarding what lacks inherent nature$Is accepted as the perfect conventional.'$$Therefore, all false phenomena appearing through this [delusion] are merely conventional. This arises due to the ripening of beginningless habitual patterns of delusion. Through this, all sentient beings see things as if they had true existence. Therefore, from the perspective of their minds, all false phenomena exist only conventionally."$$Up to "That is..." refers to the delusion of seeing things as ultimately existent when they lack ultimate inherent existence. From "conventional" to "because" explains the meaning of "perfect conventional" - taking conventional as that which obscures, it obscures the ultimate truth.$$Because it arises from grasping at true existence, what appears to exist truly through that grasping is conceptual, not sensory consciousness. This is similar to what's explained in the Commentary on the Two Truths where it states that true existence does not appear to sensory consciousness.$$The passage from "Moreover" shows this grasping at true existence to be innate, hence mentioning "all sentient beings." The "minds of those beings" refers not only to conceptual minds but also non-conceptual consciousness. By the force of these two, false phenomena exist only conventionally rather than ultimately - this is the meaning of "The arising of things is conventional." However, this does not mean they exist for the conventional consciousness that grasps at true existence.$$Thus, what exists from the object's own side rather than merely appearing to or being posited by mind is true existence, ultimate existence, or authentic existence - and grasping at this is innate grasping at true existence.
Now, regarding the statement in the text that says "ultimately there is no arising," it implies through its force that "these are not established as arising by valid knowledge." How then should we understand this explanation of what exists ultimately and that arising is established by reasoning consciousness that penetrates reality itself?$$Indeed, we must understand two types of ultimate truth when applying the qualifier "ultimate" to what is being negated. First, taking "ultimate" to mean the reasoning consciousness of hearing, contemplation, and meditation, which as explained earlier does not establish [inherent existence]. Second, taking "ultimate" to mean what exists in the mode of reality independent of mind's imputation. Of these two, the first type of ultimate truth and what is established for it do exist, while both the latter type of ultimate truth and what exists there are impossible.$$Therefore, while whatever exists in the latter ultimate must exist in the former ultimate, the conception of existence in the former is not innate grasping at true existence, whereas grasping at true existence requires the conception of existence in the latter sense. Without distinguishing this, many errors have occurred in identifying the measure of what is to be negated as "able to withstand analysis" and in grasping at phenomena that withstand analysis. Based on this, many mistakes have emerged where some consider ultimate truth to be non-existent while others consider it to be truly existent.$$When this is well understood, one will come to know the essential points of how statements that something "does not exist in reality" or "does not exist ultimately" are not contradictory with asserting that suchness exists and declaring it to be the nature of reality and ultimate truth.
Second, to understand how things exist as either mentally imputed or not mentally imputed, it is praised to understand this through the example of magical illusions. When explained: When a magician transforms wood and stones into horses and oxen, there are three perspectives - that of the magician, the deceived spectators, and those whose eyes are not deceived. For the first (the magician), there is mere appearance as horses and oxen but no grasping at them as real. For the second (deceived spectators), there is both appearance and grasping. For the third (undeceived), there is neither appearance nor grasping of horses and oxen.$$When the basis of the illusion appears as horses and oxen, it is like when a rope appears as a snake - just as we say that for the consciousness that mistakes it, the rope is a snake but is not actually a snake in general terms. Similarly, horses and oxen appear only to the mistaken consciousness, but we cannot say that the basis of the illusion does not appear as horses and oxen in general. Without applying such distinction, we must accept that the basis appears as horses and oxen, because if it didn't appear at all, the possibility of mistaken appearance would be impossible.$$Therefore, the ability to establish that the basis appears as horses and oxen is, from the magician's perspective, established by the power of mistaken consciousness appearing that way, not by the way the basis exists from its own side. For the spectators, the appearance as horses and oxen does not register as being established by their inner consciousness; rather, they grasp at genuine horses and oxen as occupying that physical space.
This is the way of grasping what is and is not established by the power of mind through examples. When an appearance arises in that basis, there are two possibilities: whether it exists in accordance with how it appears or not. When this is well understood, regarding the establishment of objects of valid cognition by the power of valid cognition - since valid cognition is also mind, establishing objects of cognition by it would also become established by the power of mind. Thus, one might think that even according to the systems of Realists, true existence would be refuted. However, these two aspects should not be confused: the establishment of objects of cognition by the power of valid cognition means that valid cognition realizes the mode of existence of the two objects of cognition, which is completely different from the former case.
According to the Yogācāra-Madhyamaka view, illusory appearances are established by self-aware direct perception, while according to the Svātantrika who accept external objects, they are established by sensory direct perception that apprehends the basis like ground or space. The fact that things do not exist as they appear is negated by reasoning such as: "If they existed in that way, they would be seen by unimpaired eyes, but since they are not seen by them..." When both the appearance and its emptiness are established together, it is established as false in relation to the conventional mind that has not entered into philosophical tenets. Therefore, the understanding that establishes emptiness of what appears as reflections does not fall into either subtle or gross rational cognition. Even if something is truly established from the perspective of conventional mind alone, if there is appearance, there cannot be emptiness of it, and if there is emptiness, there cannot be appearance of it. Thus, when both occur together, it is merely false from the perspective of conventional mind alone.
Third, just as a spectator of illusions with distorted vision, when beings perceive these outer and inner phenomena as truly existent, holding that these phenomena have a way of existing that is not merely posited by the power of mind's appearance is the innate grasping at true existence that has existed since beginningless time. When the Svatantrika establish it this way, compared to the object of negation according to the Prasangika, it is very coarse and is not the subtle innate grasping at true existence. When true existence as conceived by that grasping is refuted through reasoning, then like a magician, one no longer grasps at outer and inner phenomena as having a way of existing independent of being posited by inner consciousness, but understands them as merely existing through being posited by mind. Furthermore, only what is posited by mind and not contradicted by valid cognition is accepted as conventionally existent, but not everything posited by mind is accepted as conventionally existent. Although a sprout arising from a seed is posited by mind, it is not contradictory that the sprout also arises from the seed from its own side, just as the basis of magical illusion appears as horses and oxen from its own side. By this, all conventional existents should be understood. Even ultimate reality (dharmatā) is established as existing through the power of the mind to which it appears, so there is no pervasion in establishing it as conventionally existent.
Therefore, just as a magical illusion appears as a horse or ox yet is empty of being that, likewise all things such as vases appear as vases yet are empty of being vases. This is not at all the meaning of relating magical illusions and other phenomena as example and meaning. If it were so, it would be impossible for things to be what they are, and the relationship between example and meaning would appear that way but not actually be that way.$$When non-conceptual wisdom arises in meditative equipoise, all dualistic appearances are pacified in its perspective, just as someone with unclouded eyes has neither the appearance nor attachment to magical illusions.$$Since the unique methods of logical refutation by the Svātantrika will be explained below, if we briefly explain here their system of how all phenomena appear like magical illusions in an easily understandable way: Among objects of knowledge, which are definitively either existent or non-existent things, if we explain first about existent things: Existent things are definitively either material or non-material. For material things, one should negate partless directions like east etc., and for consciousness, one should negate partless moments of time as explained elsewhere. Then establish that all existent things necessarily have parts. Then show that if parts and the whole were inherently different entities they would become unrelated, so refute that and demonstrate they are of one nature.
At that time, when focusing the mind thus, although the essential nature is one, in terms of appearance it manifestly appears as different natures - this is undeniable. Therefore, like an illusion, one should definitively establish the unity of both its appearance and its emptiness. Then, while there is no contradiction in the false mode of existence that is posited by the power of such appearances to the mind, if the basis were to exist in a way that was not posited by the power of its appearance to the mind, it would be completely illogical. This is because, as explained before, it is impossible for true existence to have a discrepancy between how it exists and how it appears, since if something were truly established, it would need to exist while completely abandoning falsity in all aspects. Furthermore, the consciousness perceiving different natures would have to be non-deceptive, which would contradict their being of one nature.
If this is established, then based on this reasoning, we can also refute the true existence of non-existent things. For even uncompounded space must be accepted as pervading certain physical forms, and within that, one must accept aspects that pervade the east and aspects that pervade other directions. Similarly, for suchness (dharmatā) too, there are many pervasive aspects and many different aspects understood by different earlier and later cognitions. Other uncompounded phenomena are similar to this. Since the many parts and the whole cannot be inherently different entities, they must be of one nature. This works for false phenomena but is impossible for truly existent ones. Thus, as explained before, this establishes that all knowable things lack true existence. This is the position of Śāntarakṣita and his spiritual heirs, and it is a fault of limited intelligence to consider parts and wholes only in terms of material things. The conventional falsity known to those whose minds are not transformed by philosophical tenets is not the same as the falsity accepted by Mādhyamikas. Although it is mentally imputed, it exists only as it appears to those [ordinary people], but in our own system, we do not accept it as merely mentally imputed to that extent.
Thus, although there is no mode of existence independent of what appears to mind, in this system it is not contradictory that there exists a mode of existence established by that [mind] which is not merely nominally designated. Therefore, there is a great difference in how the two Madhyamika schools identify what is to be negated in relation to the mind. After thoroughly guiding such individuals through this system's identification of truth and grasping at truth, and through the condensed reasoning that refutes these, if one then teaches the Prasangika system, I have observed that they can properly distinguish the views. That is why I have explained it here.
Second, in this system, if one understands how phenomena are merely established through the power of conceptual thought, then one will easily understand true grasping, which is the opposite of this understanding. This has two parts: how phenomena are established through the power of conceptual thought, and explaining true grasping which holds the opposite view.
From the Questions of Upali:$"Various delightful flowers bloom,$And magnificent golden palaces shine beautifully,$Yet here there is no actual creator of these;$They are merely established by the power of conceptual thought.$By the power of conceptual thought, worlds are conceived."$$Thus it is taught that all phenomena are established by the power of conceptual thought. There are many other teachings that state all phenomena are merely conceptually labeled and established by the power of conceptual thought.$$From the Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning:$"Since the Perfect Buddha taught$That the world is conditioned by ignorance,$Why then is it not reasonable$To say this world is conceptual thought?"$$The commentary explains this to mean that worldly things do not exist by their own nature but are merely conceptually labeled. $$From the Hundred Verses:$"Without conceptual thought,$How can desire and so forth truly exist?$Who among the wise would hold$That reality and concepts [are separate]?"$$Its commentary states: "Things exist only when there is conceptual thought, and without conceptual thought there is no existence. Just like a rope mistaken for a snake, they definitely do not exist by their own nature." Here, "reality" refers to that which exists by its own nature.
Conceptual thought arises in dependence upon that. The commentary explains that attachment and other [afflictions] are like mistaking a rope for a snake - this is just an example. It explains that all other phenomena are also merely conceptually designated, like mistaking a rope for a snake. In this case, when the color pattern and coiled shape appear similar to a snake, and the object is seen unclearly, the thought "this is a snake" arises. At that time, neither the rope's collection nor its parts can serve as the basis for establishing a snake - there isn't even the slightest basis. Therefore, that snake is merely conceptually imputed. Similarly, when the thought "I am" arises in dependence upon the aggregates, there isn't the slightest basis for establishing its referent, whether in terms of the temporal collection of aggregates (past and future), the simultaneous collection, or their parts - this will be explained in detail below. Therefore, since there isn't even the slightest basis for holding something separate from the parts and whole of the aggregates as its referent, that "I" is merely conceptually designated in dependence upon the aggregates and does not exist by its own nature.
This is also stated in the Precious Garland (Ratnavali):$"A person is not earth, not water,$Not fire, not wind, not space,$Not consciousness, not all of these combined.$What person exists apart from these?"$$Regarding this, 'person' refers to the individual, sentient being, 'I', and self. From "not earth" up to "not consciousness" refutes that any of the six elements of sentient beings are the person, and "not all" refutes that any combination of elements constitutes the person. The final phrase refutes that a person exists as an entity separate from the elements. However, this does not mean that we deny the conventional existence of persons, nor do we accept the alaya-consciousness and such as constituting the person. This is also accepted by the Noble One (Nagarjuna), as explained by the commentator.
When one understands how persons are established by conceptual thought, one sees that all other phenomena are similarly established by conceptual thought. As stated in the King of Samadhi Sutra: "Just as you understand the conception of self, apply that understanding to everything." And from the Noble Collection: "Just as I am, so should all beings be known; just as all beings are, so should all phenomena be known." Furthermore, the Precious Garland clearly states: "Because a person is a collection of six elements, they are not ultimately real. Similarly, each element, being composite, is not ultimately real." The meaning of the first line is that a person is merely designated in dependence upon the collection of six elements. The meaning of the third and fourth lines is that since nothing can exist without parts and whole, each element is designated in dependence upon the collection of its many parts, and therefore is not inherently existent. When something is designated in dependence upon the collection of parts, neither the parts nor the whole can serve as its basis, and nothing separate from these two can exist as its basis. Although the way that conceptual thought establishes things like pots is similar to mistaking a rope for a snake, there is a crucial difference between actual things like pots and false perceptions like seeing a snake in a rope in terms of their existence, functionality, and so forth. They are completely different regarding whether their conventional designations need to be determined and whether there are contradictions in their conventional usage.
The validity of each function established by conceptual thought is as follows: Among the commentators of words and meanings, these three masters - Buddhapālita, Śāntideva, and this master (Candrakīrti) - have a unique way of commenting on the Noble Father and Son (Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva). This is also the most difficult point in understanding the ultimate Madhyamaka view.$$If we consider this, as stated in the Ratnāvalī:$"Since form is mere name,$Space too is mere name.$Without elements, how can form exist?$Therefore, even mere name does not exist.$Feeling, perception, formations,$And consciousness are like elements,$Should be considered like self;$Therefore, the six elements are selfless."$$And:$"Apart from conventional designation,$What exists or does not exist$In terms of worldly meaning?"$$This shows that ultimately even mere names do not exist, and conventionally nothing exists except what is merely established by the power of verbal convention. Thus, everything exists merely as nominal designation.$$When these points are well understood, one will properly understand that all phenomena must be established dependently, and because they are dependently designated and dependently arisen, they lack inherent existence. One will understand that they have no independent nature that is not established by the power of other conventions, and that whenever we posit the existence of any phenomenon, we must do so without analyzing the designated object.
Second, grasping at existence that is not merely established by the power of conventional designations as explained before is the innate grasping at things as truly existent, ultimately existent, perfectly established, existing by their own essence, by their own characteristics, and by their own nature. The referent object grasped by this is the measure of truth in terms of ultimate analysis.$$Regarding applying the qualifier "ultimate" to what is to be negated, here too one needs to understand the two approaches. Although the Svātantrika Madhyamikas accept that establishment as true and the other two are impossible for knowable objects, they accept that establishment by own essence and the other two exist conventionally. This is seen as a great skillful means for gradually leading those who cannot easily realize the extremely subtle ultimate truth.$$Thus, the nature of phenomena that does not depend on other conceptual conventional consciousnesses - meaning not established by their power - is called the self to be negated. The absence of this very nature with respect to the basis of persons is the selflessness of persons, and its absence with respect to phenomena like eyes and nose is taught as the selflessness of phenomena. Therefore, one can implicitly understand that grasping at this nature as existing with respect to persons and phenomena is the grasping at the two selves.$$As stated in the Commentary on the Hundred Verses: "Here, 'self' refers to the independent nature or essence of things that does not rely on others. The absence of that is selflessness. This is understood as twofold through the division into phenomena and persons, called the selflessness of phenomena and the selflessness of persons." This text also states: "Through the division of phenomena and persons, two types are taught." This explains that the two types of selflessness are distinguished by their bases (subjects) rather than by what is to be negated.
Regarding the innate view of self-grasping identity, the root text refutes that aggregates are its object of observation, while the commentary states that the dependently imputed self is the object of observation. Therefore, it observes just the mere "I" that arises when thinking "I am" and just the mere person. As for its aspect, according to the auto-commentary: "Self-grasping conceptualizes a non-existent self as existent thinking 'there is a self,' and clings to this as truly existent." Thus, it grasps that "I" as truly established.$$Furthermore, as stated in the auto-commentary: "In this context, the view of the transitory collection is contaminated wisdom that engages in the aspect of thinking 'I' and 'mine.'" Therefore, since the object of observation of innate self-identity view must naturally give rise to the thought "I am," although the innate self-grasping that holds other beings' persons to be inherently existent is innate personal self-grasping, it is not innate self-identity view.$$The phrase "engages in the aspect of thinking 'I' and 'mine'" does not indicate mere "I" and mere "mine" as objects of the aspect of apprehension, but rather shows the aspect that grasps these two as inherently existent.
The object of innate self-grasping view of the transitory collection is the sense of "mine-ness" itself, not taking one's eyes and other faculties as the object. Its aspect is grasping onto that object and holding that "mine-ness" exists through its own characteristics. $$Now, one might wonder about the auto-commentary's statement that "This grasping at 'this is mine' is attachment to all aspects of phenomena other than the object of self-grasping," which explains that grasping at "mine" means focusing on bases like eyes and clinging to them as "this is mine."$$This refers to seeing eyes and other faculties as belonging to self and then clinging to this "mine-ness" as truly existent. It is not indicating that eyes and other faculties are the actual referents of "mine-ness." If it were otherwise, there would be no contradiction between the view of the transitory collection and grasping at the inherent existence of phenomena.
The object of innate grasping at the inherent existence of phenomena includes the form aggregates and sense faculties like eyes and ears of oneself and others, as well as the external environment not included in the mental continuum. The aspect is as explained before. Such grasping at the two types of self is the ignorance that binds beings to samsara. As stated in the Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness:$$"That which conceives things produced from causes and conditions as truly existent, the Teacher declared as ignorance. From that arise the twelve links."$$This explains that grasping at phenomena as truly established while focusing on them is the root ignorance of samsara. Since the ignorance of grasping at personal self arises from grasping at the inherent existence of phenomena, it is explained that the twelve links arise from that.$$To reverse this ignorance, one needs to see the emptiness of how things are grasped and the selflessness of what is grasped. As stated in the Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness:$$"Through seeing reality correctly, understanding phenomena as empty, ignorance does not arise. That is the cessation of ignorance. Therefore the twelve links cease."$$And as stated in Praise of Dharmadhatu:$"As long as one grasps at 'I' and 'mine' and conceptualizes external objects, when one sees the two types of selflessness, the seeds of existence will cease."$$And: "The supreme mind-purifying dharma is that which is without inherent nature."$$Also from the Four Hundred Verses:$"When selflessness is seen in objects, the seeds of existence will cease."$"Therefore, by destroying delusion, all afflictions will be destroyed. When dependent origination is seen, delusion will not arise. Therefore, with all effort, just this should be explained here."
In this way, the ignorance spoken of here refers to identifying the ignorance that is one of the three poisons, which is afflictive ignorance. To overcome this ignorance, it is taught that one must realize the profound meaning of dependent origination where emptiness appears as the meaning of dependent arising. The commentator also states that "The yogi negates the self," meaning one must realize selflessness by refuting the object of self-grasping.$$Therefore, merely withdrawing the mind from its objects without refuting the object of self-grasping cannot be considered as entering into selflessness. The reason is that when the mind engages with objects, there are three possibilities: grasping them as truly existent, grasping them as lacking true existence, or grasping them without being qualified by either of these two. Just as one need not grasp things as truly existent even when not grasping them as lacking true existence, one need not have entered into the two selflessnesses even when not engaging with the two selves, because there are countless mental states that remain in the third category.$$The two types of self-grasping must be identified within one's own mental continuum, and one must establish that the very basis of one's confusion does not exist as it is conceived. Without doing this, engaging in outward-directed negation and affirmation is like searching for footprints in the forest after the thief has already gone - it misses the crucial point.$$When true-existence grasping is properly identified in this way, one will understand that there are many conceptual thoughts that are neither of the two types of self-grasping. This will dispel all misconceptions that think every object conceived by conceptual thought must be negated by reasoning that analyzes ultimate reality. While there is much more to explain regarding these points, some have already been explained elsewhere and some will be explained below, so I will not elaborate further here.
Second, there are two parts: establishing the selflessness of phenomena through reasoning, and establishing the selflessness of persons through reasoning. The first has four sections: refuting production from the four extremes in both ultimate and conventional truth; dispelling objections to such refutation; how dependent origination itself refutes misconceptions of extremist views; and identifying the results of logical analysis. The first of these has three parts: establishing the thesis that there is no inherent production; showing the logical proofs that establish this; and the meaning established through refuting production from the four extremes.
First, among the ten kinds of sameness previously explained, by demonstrating through reasoning the sameness of non-arising by inherent nature alone, considering that it would be easy to demonstrate other types of dharma sameness, Ārya [Nāgārjuna] presented at the beginning of the Madhyamaka treatise:$$"Not from self, not from other,$Not from both, not without cause,$Whatever entities there may be,$Nowhere, ever, do they arise."$$"Ever" and "at all" are synonymous. The term "wherever" (gang na yang), which is synonymous with "anywhere" (agar yang), indicating the basis where non-arising occurs, is a locative term that explains the place, time, and philosophical tenets.
The terms referring to "non-arising" in these three bases describe both external and internal phenomena. Therefore, the meaning of the text starting with "from self" should be explained as follows: External and internal phenomena cannot possibly arise from themselves in any place, time, or philosophical tenet system. Similarly, phenomena can never possibly arise from others, from both [self and other], or without causes. This should also be applied to the other three assertions.$$Although the Clear Words translates it as "whatever entities from self," this translation is better. One might think it's like saffron not growing in certain places due to location, or crops not growing at certain times due to season - this is refuted by the phrase "in whatever place and time," so the term "never" is not meaningless. Although there is no arising according to the Madhyamaka tenet system, one might think there is arising according to the Realist schools' tenets - this is refuted by "in whatever tenet system," so it's not teaching that there is no arising only according to the Realist systems.$$The Auto-commentary states: "Here, the term 'is not' connects with 'arising from self' as the proof of existence, but not with existence itself, because the refutation of that is established implicitly." This means we should not separate the first two lines as showing the reason and the latter two lines as showing the assertion, but rather connect them as "arising from self does not exist." The same applies to the other three. Since if inherent arising existed, one would have to accept one of the four extremes of arising as its proof, it mentions "proof of existence." When arising from the four extremes is refuted, the refutation of inherent arising is also established implicitly - this is the meaning of the final phrase, showing there is no fault of failing to establish the absence of inherent arising when connected this way.
Therefore, as explained in Madhyamakaloka, it's not saying that proving the absence of inherent production using the reasoning of refuting production from the four extremes is invalid. Rather, it means that separately analyzing each [extreme] is not the intention of that text. Things cannot possibly arise from others in any established extreme of place or time. As stated in Prasannapada: "We accept conventional existence merely through this-dependent origination, but not through accepting the four extremes, because that would result in asserting things have inherent nature."$$Thus, production from other is not a conventional term from the scriptures but rather terminology used by philosophical schools. Since this refers to "other" that is established by its own characteristics, accepting it would result in asserting inherent nature. In this system, there is no production from other even conventionally. Although cause and effect are accepted as conventionally different entities, this alone does not constitute production from other. Just as it is taught that even each phenomenon conventionally holds two natures, while there may be established natures, they are not accepted as natures that are inherently produced.
From the Prasannapadā, the thesis that things do not arise from themselves is explained as a non-affirming negation. Since this applies similarly to the other three theses, when establishing the absence of inherent existence, what is to be proven is merely a non-affirming negation that eliminates what is to be negated. As stated in the Prasannapadā: "Whatever terms exist in the world, all express non-affirming negations such as 'non-existence' and 'nothing whatsoever.' Therefore, the meaning of 'non-existence of things' means the absence of inherent existence."$$In the auto-commentary, after stating these four theses, it mentions they are explained to be established through reasoning. Later, using the refutation of production from the four extremes as a logical reason, it states that things are free from inherently existent production. The Prasannapadā also states after refuting production from four extremes: "Therefore, this proves that production does not exist." Thus, it's not that it refuses to prove the absence of inherently existent production of things.$$When the Prasannapadā states "Inferences merely have the result of refuting others' theses," it means the logical formulations merely refute the opponent's assertion of inherent existence and prove nothing beyond that, but this doesn't negate proving mere negations. Similarly, when it states "We do not prove existence or non-existence, but refute what others have imputed as existent or non-existent, because we wish to establish the Middle Way by eliminating the two extremes," it means it merely eliminates the extremes of existence and non-existence accepted by opponents, and proves nothing else beyond that.
It is not merely a negation of the two extremes, nor is it just an establishment, as it is taught that one establishes the Middle Way by eliminating the two extremes. If it were not the absence of inherent existence, then since there is no third alternative, it would have inherent existence. As clearly stated in the Vigrahavyāvartanī: "If through the very nature of emptiness, you negate emptiness itself, when emptiness itself is negated, inherent existence would be established."$$For this reason, even though we accept such thesis and proof, the reason why we do not become Svātantrika is extensively explained elsewhere multiple times, so I will not elaborate here.$$Then, what are the characteristics of the two types of negation? In general, negation is that which is to be understood by the mind directly cutting off the object of negation. Therefore, merely cutting off what is not itself, like in the case of positive phenomena, is not negation. And although terms like "suchness" and "ultimate truth" do not directly negate anything, when their meaning appears to the mind, they appear as having the aspect of cutting off elaborations - these are negations.
Of the two types [of negation], non-affirming negation is when the mind eliminates the object of negation directly without implying or establishing another phenomenon. For example, when a Brahmin asks whether it is appropriate or inappropriate to drink alcohol, saying "Do not drink alcohol" merely eliminates the act of drinking alcohol without establishing whether other beverages should or should not be drunk.$$Affirming negation is when the mind, after eliminating the object of negation, implies or establishes another phenomenon. For example, when wanting to indicate that a person belongs to the commoner caste, saying "This person is not a Brahmin" not only negates them being a Brahmin but also establishes that they belong to the commoner caste, which is inferior to Brahmins in terms of learning and so forth.$$The implication of other phenomena can occur in three ways: directly, indirectly, and contextually.
First, it is like saying "selflessness exists," which accomplishes both eliminating the object of negation and implying another phenomenon through a single phrase. Second, it is like saying "the fat Chöjin does not eat during the day," which is shown through implication. These two are individual cases of explicit and implicit implications respectively. An example containing both would be "there exists a fat Chöjin who does not eat during the day and is not thin."
Third, in a case where a person is definitely either of royal lineage or a brahmin but the specific distinction is uncertain, one's own words do not indicate "this is not a brahmin." As quoted in the Commentary on the Lamp of Wisdom: "Negation shown through meaning, affirmation made through a single word, and that which possesses these does not show through one's own words - this is what is meant by 'not being other than other.'"$$Some say it is incorrect to claim that when combined with an established base, it is not a non-affirming negation. This is because being a brahmin is an affirmation, but it does not negate that "brahmins do not drink alcohol" is merely an elimination of what is negated. For example, just as sound being manifest does not negate that sound's impermanence is hidden.$$Others who say "when combined with a base, it implies other phenomena" are also incorrect. This is because something like "brahmin" is the basis for determining whether other phenomena are implied or not, rather than being the implied other phenomenon itself.$$The four assertions of the Noble One presented here are: effects do not arise from their own nature; how could they arise from other inherently established causes - they do not; they do not arise from both self and other; and how could they arise without causes - they cannot.$$If inherently existent things existed, they would necessarily arise in one of these four ways, because inherent arising is definitively either with or without causes, and arising with causes is definitively limited to arising from self alone, other alone, or both together - hence four assertions are sufficient.
Second, there are four: refuting self-production, refuting production from other, refuting production from both, and refuting production without causes. The first has two parts: refutation through the reasoning of the commentators and refutation through the reasoning of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā. The first has three: refuting the position of those philosophical systems that claim to understand ultimate reality, showing that it doesn't exist even conventionally for those whose minds are not influenced by philosophical systems, and summarizing the meaning of these refutations. The first has two: refuting production from causes that are of the same nature, and refuting that cause and effect are of the same nature. The first has three: the consequence that production from causes of the same nature would be meaningless, showing that production from things of the same nature contradicts reasoning, and refuting the responses that attempt to avoid these faults.
First, if one asks what is the reason for determining that things do not arise from themselves: If the sprout, which is the agent of the action of arising while arising, were to emerge from its own nature, there would be no additional benefit needed for such emergence, because the sprout's own nature was already obtained during the time of the cause.$$Regarding this, the Samkhyas assert that while different causes and conditions have one common effect, this requires a single primary nature (pradhana) that pervades all causes and conditions. Thus, whatever is the nature of the barley seed is also the nature of conditions like water and fertilizer. Similarly, they maintain that the nature of the sprout and the nature of its causes and conditions are mutually identical. They assert this about the nature of all manifestations.$$Therefore, although they accept that seed and sprout are entirely distinct and don't claim the sprout arises from itself, when they say the sprout arises from the seed and its nature, since the two natures are one, arising from its own nature and the existence of the unmanifest sprout at the time of the cause is their way of asserting self-production.$$Some Samkhyas don't speak of arising but rather assert that what was previously unmanifest in the cause later becomes manifest, though the meaning is the same. This is also how they assert the universal and particular are one in nature, which is completely different from how Buddhists assert that entities and pots are one in nature.$$Thus, if all that constitutes the essence or nature of the sprout exists at the time of the seed, a manifest sprout different from the sprout's essence would be impossible. Therefore, not only must the sprout's nature or essence exist at the time of the cause, but the sprout itself must also exist. In that case, there would be absolutely no purpose in it arising again after it is already established.
Secondly, that which has already been produced cannot logically be produced again after its initial production. The word "also" indicates that not only would self-production from its own nature be meaningless. If one holds the position of manifestation, then if the manifest result exists at the time of the cause, it contradicts what was accepted; if it does not exist, then one should analyze and refute whether the manifestation of the result and its nature are the same or different.
The assertion that self-arising contradicts logic is merely a claim, so to demonstrate the reasoning that refutes it: If one were to accept the notion that an already germinated seed would sprout again repeatedly, then what reason is there to prevent the seed from sprouting again after blocking its germination and accepting the sprout's emergence? There would be no obstacle. Therefore, in this world, one would never find the arising of sprouts and so forth, such as stems and hollow formations. Another fault is that the seed itself would continue to arise uninterruptedly until the end of existence, because what has already arisen would need to arise again. This shows two faults: the non-arising of similar types of effects and the uninterrupted arising of similar types of causes, thus demonstrating the contradiction with logic.
Third, suppose one thinks: "When conditions beneficial to the sprout's arising - such as water and spring season - transform the seed like a soaked grain and produce the sprout, and since the sprout cannot coexist with its producer (the seed), the seed must cease. Therefore, there are no faults of contradicting reasoning as previously mentioned. Also, since the seed and sprout are not different in nature or essence, it's not a case of self-production either."$$This too is incorrect. Because if the natures of seed and sprout were completely identical, how could the sprout destroy that seed? It couldn't - just as a sprout doesn't destroy itself. Even seeing this contradiction, some foolish opponents don't back down, arguing: "The sprout's destruction of the seed occurs at the level of manifestation, so how can you compare it to self-destruction?" However, if their essential natures are completely identical in both directions, even distinct manifestations would be impossible, so this objection cannot avoid the contradiction.
Second, there are three parts:$1. Refutation through the absurd consequence that there would be no difference in shape and other qualities between the seed and sprout$2. Refutation of the response that attempts to avoid those faults$3. Refutation through the absurd consequence that there would be equal grasping and non-grasping of both during each of the two stages
First, there are other faults. According to you, there would be no distinction between the seed (cause) that produces the sprout and the sprout's characteristics - such as its long or short shape, colors like blue and yellow, tastes like sweet and sour, potency, and ripening effects - which are different from the seed's color, shape, and other qualities. This is because there would be no difference whatsoever between the nature and essence of the seed and sprout. However, since they are observed to be not identical, their essences cannot be completely the same. This makes a refutation, and there is a great difference between making a refutation and making an independent reverse argument.$$Here, "potency" refers to things like medicines for hemorrhoids that cure just by being close to the body, or certain herbal medicines that enable flight through the sky just by holding them. "Ripening" refers to the transformation of substances through different conditions - for example, how myrobalan and long pepper become sweet when soaked in milk.
Secondly, if one argues that because the seed transforms into a different state of sprout after abandoning its state as a seed, and since seed and sprout are merely different states, therefore the seed itself transforms into the sprout - [this is incorrect]. If after removing the essential nature of the previous seed's state, it transforms into a different state, that of the sprout's nature, then how can it be logical to say that the nature of that seed is identical to the nature of the sprout? This is because that state's entity is its very essence, and there is no entity of it separate from its nature. Therefore, the assertion that the natures of these two - seed and sprout - are completely identical fails. If one thinks there's no contradiction because although the shape etc. of seed and sprout are different, their substance is not different, this is incorrect because without grasping the shape and other attributes, one cannot grasp the substance of seed and sprout either.
Third, there are other faults. If, according to you, the seed and sprout do not have different natures in this world, then just as the seed cannot be perceived during the time of the sprout, the sprout too should not be perceivable. Or alternatively, since their natures would be completely identical, just as the sprout is perceivable during the time of the sprout, the seed too should be perceivable by sensory consciousness, but it is not. Therefore, to avoid these two faults, one should not accept that there is no difference between the natures of seed and sprout. When these logical arguments are well understood, regarding all phenomena that are mutually different in nature, it will dispel all misconceptions that claim their ultimate natures are identical to each other, or that the ultimate nature at an earlier stage is identical to the ultimate nature at a later stage.
Therefore, in this way, having refuted self-production as conceived by the Samkhya system which desires to understand ultimate reality differently from the Buddhist system, [this verse] shows that even in conventional worldly terms - without being trained in other philosophical systems - the concept of self-production is untenable. This is because even when a seed (cause) has disintegrated, its result can still be observed, and therefore even ordinary people do not accept that the seed and sprout are of the same essential nature.
Third, because it contradicts reasoning from both the ultimate truth and conventional worldly perspectives that things arise from self, therefore, the assertion that inner and outer phenomena arise from self is not reasonable in either ultimate truth or conventional worldly truth. Thus when the Noble One refutes self-arising, he generally negates self-arising without making distinctions between ultimate and conventional truth by stating "not from self." Therefore, when Master Bhāvaviveka qualifies his statement by saying "phenomena do not arise from self ultimately because they exist, like conscious beings," we should understand that his qualification of "ultimately" is meaningless.
Secondly, there are other faults. If one accepts that effects arise from self, then the effect to be produced, the cause that produces, the action to be done, and the agent who does it would all become one and the same. However, since these are not one and the same, self-arising should not be accepted, as it would lead to the faults extensively explained in this treatise and in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā.$$The first fault is stated in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā: "Cause and effect being one and the same is never reasonable. If cause and effect were one, producer and produced would be the same." This means if cause and effect were of the same nature, father and son, or eye and eye-consciousness would also become one and the same.$$The second fault is stated in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā: "If wood were fire, then agent and action would become one." When refuted thus, if one argues that father and son, agent and action would become of the same nature, we accept that specific conclusion, but if one argues they become generally one, there is no such necessity. However, as explained before, if one accepts they are of the same inherent nature, one cannot refute the logical consequence that their manifestations would also become one.$$Therefore, fearing the faults as explained, those who wish to correctly understand the two truths should not accept self-arising. Moreover, since the existence and non-existence of self-arising are direct contradictories where affirming one necessarily eliminates the other, when self-arising is negated, one must necessarily accept its non-existence.
Second, there are two [parts]: Stating the previous position and refuting that system.
First, the Buddhist realists (Vaibhāṣikas) say that self-production is meaningless and therefore invalid, and without that, production from both [self and other] is also invalid. While production without causes should certainly be refuted as it is completely invalid, it is not reasonable to refute production from other because the scriptures speak of the four conditions - which are inherently other - as producers of phenomena. Therefore, even if unwillingly, we must accept production from other based on scripture. $$Regarding how the four conditions are established: Some schools explain them based on the Abhidharma: The causal condition refers to the five causes (excluding the efficient cause); the objective condition refers to all phenomena that are objects of the six consciousnesses; the immediate condition refers to previous mental states and mental factors except those entering final nirvana; and the dominant condition is explained as the efficient cause.$$The six causes as explained in the Abhidharma are: efficient cause, co-arising cause, homogeneous cause, associated cause, omnipresent cause, and ripening cause.$$Some schools define them differently: The causal condition is that which exists as a seed producing an effect. The objective condition is like a staff supporting an old person getting up - it is the object that produces mental states and mental factors as they arise. The immediate condition is the cause that has just ceased, like a seed that has just ceased produces a sprout. The dominant condition is that upon whose existence something arises. The Clear Words commentary includes within these prior-arising, co-arising, and subsequent-arising factors, and the Auto-commentary states similarly except for the first one.$$This accords with what the Prajñāpradīpa describes as "conditions theorized by other schools as being prior-arisen, existent and non-existent." According to its commentary, the prior-arisen condition refers to the objective condition that appears before the senses; the existent condition refers to causal and dominant conditions; and the non-existent condition refers to the immediate condition. While there are such terminological differences, when examining their characteristics, they all reduce to these four conditions. Since factors like Īśvara (God) are not conditions, there is no fifth condition. This is definitively held according to the Abhidharma's statement that "Mental states and mental factors arise from four [conditions], the two absorptions from three, other [phenomena] from two, not from Īśvara etc., because of sequence etc."
Second, there are two parts: a general refutation of the position of production from other, and a specific refutation of the Cittamatra (Mind-Only) system. The first has five parts: the actual refutation of production from other; dispelling worldly objections to the refutation; showing the benefits of such refutation; demonstrating that inherent production does not exist anywhere; and showing the benefits of refuting inherently existent production in both conventional and ultimate truths. The first has three parts: general refutation of production from other; specific refutation of production from other; and refutation of production from other through analysis of the four possibilities regarding effects. The first has two parts: refutation through reductio ad absurdum and refutation of attempts to avoid the faults. The first has two parts: the actual reductio ad absurdum and analysis of its implications.
First, production from other cannot be established because it contradicts both reasoning and scripture. Regarding the latter, it contradicts many scriptures like the Rice Seedling Sutra which states "The sprout of name and form is neither made by self nor made by other."$$Regarding reasoning, if an inherently existent effect were to arise from an inherently existent other cause, then:$1) Thick darkness would arise from blazing flames that dispel darkness$2) All effects, whether possible or impossible, would arise from all causes, whether appropriate or inappropriate$$Why? Because for those who assert production from other, both the causal relationship and the quality of being inherently different things would be equally present in both proper causes and non-causes. $$These two absurd consequences can be explained as follows: Just as a rice seed is inherently different from the rice sprout it produces, fire, charcoal, barley seeds etc. (which don't produce rice sprouts) are also inherently different from rice sprouts according to proponents of production from other. If these two types of "otherness" are equivalent, then just as rice sprouts arise from the "other" that is rice seeds, they should also arise from fire and charcoal. Similarly, just as rice sprouts arise from the "other" that is rice seeds, pots and cloth should also arise from rice seeds.$$This follows the reasoning in Nagarjuna's Fundamental Wisdom which states:$"Cause and effect being other$Can never be acceptable.$If cause and effect were other,$Causes would equal non-causes."$$The commentary explains that both absurd consequences can be reversed.
Second, there are two [points]: The reason why excessive consequences apply to production from other, and [showing] there is no contradiction in accepting the opposite of the consequences.
First, regarding the reason why accepting production from other leads to excessive logical consequences, some Tibetans say it is because causes and effects must be sequential, while "other" requires simultaneity. This is completely unreasonable because all the faults they refute equally apply to themselves, and if they deny having accepted this position, then the effort of searching for its reasoning becomes meaningless.$$Furthermore, many Tibetans claim that when logicians prove that where there is a specific smoke there must be fire, and whatever is produced must be impermanent, they are proving these relationships hold true for all times and places. When proving this, they first establish it in a single limited case like a kitchen hearth or a pot, and then, based on the similarity of type between that and other times and places, they try to prove these relationships hold true without exception for all times and places. However, this leads to excessive consequences through the mere reasoning of similarity to others. This is what is called "pushing with the force of single exclusion."
This is a discussion about those who have not ascertained the meaning of the texts and whose logical understanding has not dawned. When proving that specific smoke and being produced are unfailing signs of fire and impermanence respectively, without being qualified by place and time, even if the existence of fire and being impermanent are reversed, can the two posited signs remain unreversed? This doubt can be well resolved. Although the causal relationship between these two phenomena may be reversed, there are many instances where they are merely different things, so how could there be room for equivalence between the two?$$Therefore, this is clearly shown to be a refutation by those who don't understand logic, as indicated by the very term "pushing force." This has been explained extensively elsewhere.$$Then how is this so? According to the Prasannapadā: "We accept conventional reality merely through this dependent origination, but not through accepting the four alternatives, because that would entail things having inherent nature, which is not logical. When accepting merely this dependent origination, since cause and effect are mutually dependent, they cannot be established by their own nature, thus things do not appear to have inherent nature."$$This clearly states two distinctions: whether or not one accepts inherent production, and as their reasoning, if one accepts production from the four alternatives, one must assert existence with inherent nature. Thus, it clearly states that if one accepts other-production, one must accept production through inherent nature, but if one accepts merely dependent origination, one need not accept production through inherent nature.$$Therefore, the "other" in other-production is not merely other, but rather an other that is inherently established. Thus, accepting this leads to absurd consequences, but accepting mere otherness does not lead to such consequences at all. As stated later regarding different moments being considered one continuum: "Those that are separate by their own characteristics cannot reasonably belong to one continuum." This reasoning is similar to the previous one.$$Furthermore, if something is other by way of inherent characteristics, it can negate dependent relationships. If things become unrelated others, then if one effect arises from its cause, it would absurdly follow that it would arise from everything that is not its cause, and if one cause produces its effect, it would absurdly follow that it would produce all existing effects that are not its effects.$$Therefore, not understanding such reasoning well is due to not properly distinguishing between these two: the measure of what is being negated when refuting such things as explained before, and the system of dependent arising that accepts just this much. Thus, when refuting what is to be negated, one should remember the explanation of the measure of what is to be negated.
Second, if one accepts the opposite meaning of the two previously explained consequences, as stated in Prasannapadā: "The opponent is connected with the opposite meaning of the consequences, but we are not, because we have no thesis." And: "When those who assert the absence of inherent existence present consequences to those who assert inherent existence, how could they be forced to accept the opposite meaning of the consequences?" And: "Therefore, since consequence proofs only serve to refute the opponent's thesis, there is no acceptance of the opposite meaning of the consequences."$$If one wonders how to interpret these statements, there is no fault because these statements only apply to the context of refuting self-production, not to all consequences presented by Mādhyamikas, but only to the two consequences refuting self-production. The consequent properties are not merely the pointlessness and infinite regress of production, but rather the pointlessness and infinite regress of re-production. The opposite meaning of these consequent properties - that re-production has purpose and is finite - is accepted only by the Sāṃkhyas. Since we have no such thesis, there is no contradiction with accepting their philosophical system - this is the meaning of the first quote.$$Buddhapālita also used the word "again" in "pointless re-production," and Prasannapadā also uses "again," stating "if one were to conceive of production again." This shows that existence and re-production are contradictory, while existence and production are not contradictory. Similarly, existence and finite re-production are contradictory, while existence and finite production are not contradictory.$$The meaning of the second quote is that when Mādhyamikas who assert the absence of inherent existence present these two consequences to the Sāṃkhyas who assert inherent existence, they do not wish to accept that the opposite meaning is implied for themselves, and even without accepting this, they are not forced to do so - thus they do not accept the opposite of these two consequences.$$The meaning of the third quote is that although the opposite meaning of the consequent properties - purposeful and finite re-production - does not prove the absence of self-production, it is not purposeless, because by proving pointless and infinite production which the Sāṃkhyas do not accept, it serves the purpose of simply negating the self-production that the Sāṃkhyas assert.$$Regarding the two over-extensions, since one accepts the opposite meaning of the consequences oneself, one should understand that there are two types of opposite meanings of consequences - those that one accepts oneself and those that one does not accept.
Second, there are two parts: The response that eliminates faults, and the refutation of that response.
First, it is said here: While there exists an inherently established otherness between cause and effect, it is not the case that everything arises from everything, because we observe specific determinations between causes and effects. This is because whatever phenomenon is capable of producing something is definitively stated to be its effect, and therefore the effect is determined. The phrase "therefore" here differs from the commentary. Whatever cause is capable of producing that effect is a cause even though it is inherently established as other, and therefore the cause is determined. Thus, cause and effect are established only by specific otherness, not by mere general otherness. Furthermore, a rice sprout arises from a rice seed belonging to the same continuum, not from barley seeds and such belonging to different continuums. Even within the same continuum, later moments do not produce earlier ones as they are not producers, so because it arises from earlier moments producing later ones within the same continuum, a rice sprout does not arise like barley sprouts arise from barley and so forth. Therefore, not everything arises from everything.
Second, one should ask this question to those who assert that cause and effect are inherently established: "What is the reason for the definite relationship between rice seeds and sprouts?" If they reply, "Because we observe this certainty," one should further ask, "Why do we observe such certainty?" When examined this way, merely saying "We observe certainty because we observe certainty" does not explain the cause of the certainty and cannot avoid the previously explained fault even slightly.$$This means that they haven't provided a reason why seeing certainty doesn't contradict things being inherently different, so it's not a valid response to the criticism.$$Furthermore, this well-known fact that inherently established otherness is common to all things, whether they are cause and effect or not, without any specific distinction, serves as a refutation of this opponent's position. For example, just as barley, lotus stamens, Kimsuka flowers, and so forth, being different, are not accepted as producing rice sprouts, do not have the capacity to produce rice sprouts, are not part of the same continuum, and are not similar preceding types, similarly, rice seeds also would not possess these four characteristics in relation to rice sprouts because they are inherently different entities. This is the reasoning that shows that no distinctions can be established between unrelated separate entities.
Second, there are two [parts]: Refuting production from other regarding cause and effect that are sequential in time, and refuting production from other regarding simultaneous cause and effect. The first has two [parts]: The actual meaning and dispelling objections to the refutation.
First, having thus stated the opponent's position of inherently established production from other as accepted by others, we will now refute it. Explaining why inherently established otherness is impossible between cause and effect: Just as Maitreya and Upagupta exist simultaneously and are seen as other in mutual dependence, saying "this is other than that," the sprout does not exist simultaneously with the seed, because without the seed's transformation, there is no sprout. The seed does not have inherently established otherness from the sprout, and without that, how could the seed possibly be other than the sprout? It cannot be. Because there is no inherently established otherness, the sprout's production from the seed cannot be inherently established. Therefore, abandon this position that things are produced from other. This means that if the difference between seed and sprout were inherently established, since what is inherently established never changes, the seed would have to be substantially different from the sprout even at the time of the seed. In that case, they would exist simultaneously, but since they do not, there is no inherently established otherness between them. This is showing that there is no inherently established otherness between the two, not refuting that cause and effect are conventionally different entities. One must understand what exactly is being negated here.
Second, it is incorrect to say that the sprout and seed do not exist simultaneously. Just as when one end of a scale beam rises and the other falls simultaneously, similarly, the processes of arising of the sprout (the produced) and cessation of the seed (the producer) occur simultaneously. Therefore, the seed and sprout exist simultaneously. Thus, there is no fault in their being different.$$If one thinks that the example of the scale proves the simultaneous occurrence of arising and cessation of seed and sprout, this is incorrect. Even if in the scale example, the rising and falling actions occur simultaneously because both ends exist at the same time, here in reality, seed and sprout do not exist simultaneously, so the analogy is invalid.$$To explain why they don't exist simultaneously: What is "in the process of arising" is about to come into present existence as a sprout, so it does not yet exist in the present. What is "in the process of ceasing" exists but is about to cease. When the sprout is about to arise, the seed exists in the present while the sprout is future. At that time, how can these two be like the rising and falling of a scale? They cannot be, because both ends of a scale exist in the present, so their rising and falling actions can be simultaneous, whereas seed and sprout do not exist simultaneously.$$This shows that the example of the scale's rising and falling being used to prove simultaneous existence of seed and sprout is invalid. It does not mean that if two actions can occur simultaneously, the two phenomena must necessarily exist simultaneously.$$If one thinks that even without simultaneous existence of phenomena like seed and sprout, their actions can be simultaneous - this too is invalid, because those opponents have not accepted actions as separate from phenomena, and this context is about refuting inherently existent actions.$$There is another fault: The agent of the action of arising (the sprout) is future when about to arise, so does not exist then. Without the existent basis (agent), the dependent action of arising cannot reasonably exist, so it cannot be simultaneous with cessation.$$Although the Noble Rice Seedling Sutra uses the analogy of the scale beam to say that in the very same instant the seed ceases, the sprout arises, this was not taught to establish production from other or production through inherent characteristics.$$Therefore, when arising is negated by saying "if this arising...", it negates only inherently existent arising, not the mere arising of sprout from seed.
If that sutra does not show the simultaneity of seed and sprout in the manner of a scale beam's up and down movement, then what kind of simultaneity is intended by this example? The commentary explains that it was taught to clarify the unexamined establishment of simultaneous dependent origination, which is like an illusion. The phrase "simultaneous dependent origination" must refer to two actions existing simultaneously, because while that sutra needs to show simultaneity through the example of a scale beam's up and down movement, it cannot be explained as the simultaneity of seed and sprout.$$Therefore, the rejection of two simultaneous actions refers to two actions established by their own characteristics, not a general rejection that two actions can be simultaneous. In this case, once arising is accepted, there must be simultaneity between the cessation of the cause and the tendency toward arising of the effect. While this poses no problem for accepting mere arising or conventional arising, it contradicts accepting ultimate or inherently characterized arising. This is because in the former case, although the two actions of arising and ceasing of cause and effect are simultaneous, cause and effect themselves need not be simultaneous. In the latter case, if the actions are simultaneous, cause and effect must also be simultaneous.$$For example, the action of arising of an effect must depend on the agent of arising (like a sprout), so they are dependent and basis. If dependent and basis were ultimately established, change of nature would be impossible. Therefore, since action must always have a basis, even when the sprout is tending toward arising, the sprout must exist as the basis for the action of arising. This leads to the fault that cause and effect would be simultaneous, making it untenable. This is not equivalent to conventional arising where temporary dependence does not necessitate permanent dependence.$$The action of sprout-arising simultaneous with the seed is the action of tending toward sprout-arising. While this and the sprout are generally dependent and basis, it is not contradictory that the sprout does not exist at the time of that action yet the action exists. This is like how generally when the object of relation is negated the related thing ceases, and while seed is the object of relation and sprout is the related thing, it's not contradictory that when the sprout exists the seed has ceased yet the sprout doesn't cease.$$Understanding well how logical arguments refute others while avoiding self-contradiction in this way, one who can establish the flawless Madhyamaka system is a Madhyamika. As stated in the Clear Words, if one merely states apparent refutations when negating but relies on denial when those same arguments are turned back, "We do not debate with madmen."
Second, some say: Although production from other is not reasonable since there is no inherent otherness due to the earth and sprout not being simultaneous, production from other exists where cause and effect are simultaneous since otherness exists there - for example, like visual consciousness and the simultaneous feelings and so forth. Just as the eye, form and so forth and feelings etc. arising together simultaneously produce visual consciousness, likewise the eye etc. and mind are also simultaneous conditions for feelings and so forth.$$If one considers the eye and so forth that are simultaneous with visual consciousness as its producers, and perceptions etc. arising together with those as conditions - even if otherness exists in relation to perceptions etc., what purpose is served by something that already exists at the time of the cause arising again? Since there is no purpose at all, there is no production.$$If, wishing to avoid the fault of no production, one says the effect does not exist at the time of the cause, then as explained before, there is the fault that there is no inherently established otherness between earlier and later. Thus, this reasoning shows that even though otherness exists in what are considered cause and effect, inherent production is impossible and therefore production from other is impossible. The previous reasoning shows that although production is possible for cause and effect, inherent otherness is impossible and therefore production from other is impossible.$$Therefore, the statement "production from other exists" becomes empty of meaning upon analysis, leaving only the mere words of such an assertion.
Third, if a cause is that which produces something other than itself as the thing to be produced, let us examine whether that cause produces an effect that inherently exists, or does not exist, or both exists and does not exist, or is free from both existence and non-existence. First, if the effect inherently exists, what need is there for producing conditions? There is no need, because if something inherently existent were to arise, it would mean that what has already arisen would arise again, which has been shown to be illogical. For a non-existent effect also, what can the conditions do? Since it is non-existent like a rabbit's horns. For both existence and non-existence combined, what can the conditions do? Because the combination of these two is impossible. And for that which is free from both existence and non-existence, what can the conditions do? Because it is impossible to be neither of these two.
Second, there are two parts: Accepting production from other according to worldly convention and dispelling worldly objections; and dispelling worldly objections by showing that even in worldly conventional terms there is no production from other. The first has two parts: The objection raised by worldly convention, and showing the response that demonstrates these objections are not valid.
First, regarding the reasoning stated to establish production from other: Like dry firewood soaked in oil, it has been completely burned by the fire of your intelligence. That kindling of reasoning ignited by your wisdom's fire is sufficient; it need not be further ignited.$$Then one might ask: "Without showing reasoning, wouldn't the thesis of production from other not be established?" This is not the case. For whatever is established by worldly convention requires no other reasoning, as worldly perception is extremely powerful, as explained: Since all worldly beings remain solely in their own views and accept worldly perception as valid, it is extremely powerful. The arising of a different effect from a different cause that exists by its own nature is directly perceived by worldly beings. When presenting logical arguments, among the two categories - what is directly perceived and what is not directly perceived - the arguments are presented for the latter category.
First, since it is established by direct valid cognition, there is no need to present logical arguments for it. Therefore, regarding the existence of production from other, what is the point of stating other logical arguments to prove its existence? Thus, even without other logical arguments to prove production from other, since things are established as arising from other, what purpose is there in showing other logical arguments here regarding the existence of production from other? There is no purpose, because it is established by direct perception - thus they argue.
Secondly, those who have not correctly understood the meaning of the scriptures and who, due to the ripening of habitual tendencies of grasping at true existence from beginningless samsara, strongly cling to phenomena as truly existent, are separated from their long-familiar friend. Being separated from repeatedly hearing the method of emptiness that causes separation [from this clinging], they rely on worldly harmful conventional ways. Since it's impossible to reverse worldly harmful conventions without explaining many ways of how the world works, it's necessary to teach: the specific objects that are harmed by the world, saying "the world harms such and such objects," and the specific objects that are not harmed by the world, saying "the world does not harm such and such objects." Regarding this, the presentation of the two truths that comes first has five aspects: the general presentation of the two truths, applying it to the present context, explaining the nature of each of the two truths, showing the refutation of worldly harm, and explaining how worldly harm operates.
First, there are four [points]:$1. Explaining that all phenomena have two natures each when divided into the Two Truths$2. Teaching other presentations of the Two Truths$3. Explaining the divisions of conventional truth in relation to the world$4. Teaching that the conceived object of misconception does not exist even conventionally
First, the Blessed Ones who perfectly understand the nature of the two truths teach that all phenomena, both internal (like mental formations) and external (like sprouts), have two natures. What are these? They are the conventional truth nature and the ultimate truth nature.$$This shows that even a single entity like a sprout has two natures when analyzed - one conventional and one ultimate. It does not mean that a single nature of the sprout is taught as two truths relative to ordinary beings and noble ones.$$Thus, since no phenomenon can exist without a nature, anything that exists must either have a single nature or different natures. While accepting that things have natures, this does not contradict their lack of inherent existence.$$The ultimate nature of phenomena like sprouts is found through the special wisdom of those who directly see reality. However, this nature is not inherently established. This is one of the two natures explained.$$The conventional nature, different from the ultimate, is found by ordinary beings whose mind's eye is completely covered by the cataract of ignorance, through the power of seeing falsity. While it appears to exist through its own characteristics to ordinary perception, it does not truly exist as it appears. This is the other of the two natures.$$When it's taught that noble ones find ultimate truth, this refers to their primary role, not excluding trained ordinary beings who have realized the Middle Way view. Similarly, when ordinary beings are said to find conventional truth, this refers to their primary role in seeing conventional phenomena through ignorance, not excluding noble ones' conventional valid cognition.
As for the second point, although there are many different views regarding the basis of division of the Two Truths, here it is applied to objects of knowledge. As quoted in the Śikṣāsamuccaya from the Sutra of the Meeting of Father and Son: "Thus the Tathāgata comprehends both conventional and ultimate truths. All that is to be known is exhausted within these conventional and ultimate truths. Moreover, the Blessed One thoroughly sees, thoroughly knows, and has perfectly realized emptiness, and therefore is called the Omniscient One."$$The phrase "all that is to be known" indicates objects of knowledge as the basis of division, "is exhausted within" shows that the number is definitively two, and it teaches that the Tathāgata is omniscient because he comprehends both truths. Therefore, it is incorrect to explain that the ultimate truth is not an object of knowledge and cannot be realized by any mind, as some interpret the Bodhicaryāvatāra.$$The division into conventional truth and ultimate truth constitutes the nature of the division. Although there are many different interpretations of what is divided, here both have existence, and since it's impossible for them to be neither one nor different in essence, and since if phenomena were different in essence from their emptiness of true existence they would become truly existent, they are one in essence but different in aspect, like 'produced' and 'impermanent.'$$As stated in the Bodhicittavivaraṇa:$"Ultimate truth is not observed$As separate from the conventional.$The conventional is explained as emptiness,$And emptiness itself is the conventional.$Because they necessarily co-exist,$Like the produced and impermanent."$$The meaning of the first four lines is that ultimate reality does not exist as something essentially separate from the conventional, because conventional things are empty of true existence, and because emptiness itself is established in relation to conventional bases.
Then, through these two, the relationship of presence and absence is ascertained. Since this is also a relationship of identity, like the impermanence of the produced, it shows they are of one nature. The identification of individual divisions is as previously explained in the characteristics of what is found by the two valid cognitions. If one asks how to explain this statement from the Bodhicaryavatara which says:$$"The conventional and ultimate -$These are held to be the two truths.$The ultimate is not the domain of the intellect;$The intellect is said to be conventional."$$Regarding this, the first two lines show the division of the two truths. When identifying the nature of each division, the identification of ultimate truth is shown by the word "ultimate," and the identification of conventional truth is shown by the word "conventional." The assertion that the third line establishes the thesis that ultimate truth is not an object of intellect through the fourth line does not appear to be the meaning of these passages at all.$$Therefore, this identification of the two truths is as quoted in the Śikṣāsamuccaya from the Pitāputrasamāgama Sūtra: "Therein, the conventional is what the Tathagata sees as worldly conduct. The ultimate is that which is inexpressible, not to be known, not to be cognized, not to be fully comprehended, not taught..." This meaning was presented in the Bodhicaryavatara.
Third, regarding conventional truth, there are two aspects - object and subject. First, in relation to worldly consciousness, the subject is shown to have two types - correct and incorrect. Not only are knowable objects divided into two truths, but false-perceiving subjects are also considered to have two types - correct and incorrect.$$There are two types of subjects: clear sense faculties (those unaffected by temporary causes of confusion) and their corresponding consciousnesses, and defective sense faculties (those affected by temporary causes of confusion). The consciousness of those with defective sense faculties is considered incorrect knowledge in relation to consciousness based on properly functioning faculties unaffected by temporary causes of confusion. The former is considered to grasp objects without distortion.$$These two distinctions are from the perspective of worldly consciousness, not the Madhyamaka view. Just as subjects are divided into distorted and undistorted, objects are similarly categorized. Whatever objects are apprehended by the six sense consciousnesses without interference from temporary causes of confusion are considered true or correct from the worldly perspective alone, not from the perspective of the noble ones. Here "noble ones" and "Madhyamaka view" mean the same thing.$$The remaining objects, like reflections etc., that appear when there is interference with the sense faculties are established as false from the worldly perspective alone. The word "alone" indicates that conventional valid cognition is sufficient to establish these cognitions as mistaken, without relying on reasoning consciousness.$$Internal causes interfering with sense faculties include cataracts, jaundice, datura consumption (which makes everything appear golden), and so forth including fevers. External causes interfering with sense faculties include mirrors, cave echoes, summer sun rays on sand near inhabited areas, etc. Though these don't involve internal sensory interference, they respectively cause misapprehension of reflections as real objects, echoes as original sounds, and mirages as water.$$Similarly, one should understand spells and medicines prepared by magicians and others. Mental faculty interference includes such things as spells, medicines, wrong philosophical views, pseudo-logical reasoning, and sleep's effects. Since sleep is described as interfering with the mental faculty among the six faculties, it is a great misstatement to claim this master accepts sense consciousness in dreams.$$Thus, the interference of ignorance grasping at self in its two forms since beginningless time is not considered a cause of interference here. Rather, temporary causes of sensory confusion as explained earlier are considered. The division into correct and incorrect regarding conventional objects apprehended by the six types of consciousness free from such interference, and their opposites, is only in relation to worldly consciousness. This is because worldly consciousness either encounters or doesn't encounter contradiction regarding objects existing as they appear.$$From the noble ones' perspective, there is no division into correct and incorrect, because just as reflections etc. don't exist as they appear, so too the blue and other objects appearing as inherently established to those with ignorance don't exist as they appear. Therefore, there is no distinction between confused and unconfused between these two types of consciousness.
Fourth, now to explain the previously discussed mental misconceptions regarding objects of attachment through specific examples:$$Those non-Buddhist philosophers, whose minds are disturbed by the sleep of ignorance, hold wrong philosophical tenets and invalid logical reasoning. Wanting to surpass ordinary people in understanding reality, they reject the commonly accepted facts about birth, death, etc. known even to cowherds and women. Like someone who lets go of the previous branch before grasping the next while climbing a tree, they fall into the ravine of wrong views through great downfall. Being devoid of proper understanding of the two truths, they cannot attain the result of liberation.$$Therefore, whatever these non-Buddhists imagine according to their own texts - whether it's the three qualities or other attributes - does not exist even conventionally. This effectively refutes the claim that whatever exists for a deluded mind exists conventionally.$$Similarly, what appears as horses, oxen, water, reflections etc. in illusions, mirages, and mirrors also does not exist even conventionally. Thus, for something to exist conventionally, it must be established by valid cognition. Although such objects of conception don't exist even conventionally, this does not apply to objects of appearance.$$Currently, when forms, sounds, etc. appear to sense consciousness as inherently existent, this is corrupted by ignorance. Besides subtle differences, there is no difference between such consciousness and the sense consciousness perceiving reflections or echoes in terms of being mistaken or unmistaken regarding objects of appearance. Although inherently existent blue, etc. and reflections as real faces are impossible, just as there are reflections that are not real faces, there must be blue etc. though not inherently existent. Just as external objects exist, reflections are also accepted as form-sources. Later it's also explained that reflections produce the sense consciousness perceiving them.$$These principles should also be understood regarding magical illusions appearing as horses and oxen to the eye, echoes, etc. This is the unique philosophical system of this supreme tradition.
Secondly, since the ultimate truth cannot be established by conventional knowledge, the refutation of production from other is not done merely from a worldly perspective, but rather is done ultimately by accepting the noble ones' vision of suchness. When applying the qualification of ultimate truth to this refutation of production from other, just as the perception of floating hairs and such by someone with eye disease does not invalidate the non-appearance of floating hairs to those with healthy vision, similarly the ordinary mind corrupted by ignorance and devoid of undefiled wisdom does not invalidate the undefiled wisdom that is uncorrupted by ignorance. Therefore, even if production from other is established from a worldly perspective, it does not invalidate the ultimate refutation of production from other. For this reason, the opponent deserves to be laughed at by the wise masters.
Third, there are two parts: explaining conventional truth and explaining ultimate truth. The first has three parts: [explaining] in whose perspective conventional truth is true and in whose perspective it is not true; the way in which mere conventional [truth] appears and does not appear to three types of beings; and how [phenomena] become ultimate and conventional in relation to ordinary beings and noble ones. The first has two parts: the actual meaning and explaining the unique presentation of afflictive emotions.
First, this is ignorance (gti mug) because it obscures and deludes beings from seeing the nature of things as they actually exist. Ignorance superimposes inherent existence onto phenomena that do not inherently exist. That which has the nature of obscuring the vision of how things actually are is the conventional (kun rdzob). This identifies the conventional [truth] in the phrase "conventional truth" and the conventional [consciousness] in whose perspective it is established. This is not identifying the conventional in general.
This identification is also found in the Lankavatara Sutra: "Things arise in conventional reality. In ultimate truth, they lack inherent nature. Whatever confusion there is about that which lacks inherent nature - that is accepted as conventional truth." This means that conventional reality is the deluded mind that misconceives things as having inherent existence when, in ultimate truth, they lack inherent nature. This conventional truth (kunzob) corresponds to the Sanskrit term for 'that which obscures' and thus acts as a concealer.
When it asks what it obscures, by saying "it is accepted as genuine conventional reality," it means that it is accepted as conventional or obscuring because it obscures the ultimate truth. This is not teaching about genuine conventional reality from among the two types of genuine and false. The conventional reality shown in the first line and the conventional reality shown in the last two lines should not be taken as the same. This is because the first refers to the conventional reality in which one accepts things as having production and so forth, while the latter refers to the conventional reality of grasping at truth - that in relation to which things appear to be truly existent.
Through the power of grasping at conventional truth, although blue and other [phenomena] lack inherent existence, they appear as if they exist inherently. This deceptive appearance that appears as true to sentient beings is what the Sage (Buddha) taught as "worldly conventional truth" because it is true for the perspective of the previously explained worldly misconception of conventional [reality]. The way this was taught is as explained in the previously mentioned sutra.
For the three types of persons, that which appears as fabricated due to conceptual thoughts that are untrue is called merely conventional because it is untrue even from the perspective of conventional reality. Dependent originations like reflections and echoes, though false, appear to those with ignorance. Some things like blue forms, consciousness, and feelings appear as true, but the natural way of being of phenomena does not appear in any way to those with ignorance. Therefore, that nature and whatever is false even conventionally are not conventional truths.
When explaining the meaning of what was stated, regarding the phrase "somewhat," it is better to translate it as "some" as in Naktso's translation. Although reflections and such are false appearances, they are appearances that are false. This falseness consists of both appearing as a face and being empty of that face. Therefore, its emptiness of truth is emptiness of being truly a face, but there is no meaning of emptiness of truth in terms of the reflection being established by its own characteristics. Therefore, although it is established that the reflection is empty of being a face, there is no contradiction in it being true for conventional wisdom that grasps the reflection as established by its own characteristics. Since it is a phenomenon that has no contradiction in being true from the perspective of conventional truth, it is a conventional truth.
Therefore, when it is said that reflections are not conventional truths, this refers to the fact that, from the perspective of worldly conventional understanding of signs and symbols, a reflection like that of a face is false in being an actual face, and thus is not a conventional truth in relation to that. However, it is taught to be a conventional truth in terms of being a false appearance. How could it not be established as a conventional truth as explained? If it were not so, and if something that is not truly existent conventionally could not be a conventional truth, this would contradict all the presentations that teach that inherent existence does not exist even conventionally, and all the systems of refuting true existence and establishing the absence of true existence conventionally. Therefore, the claim that reflections and other objects that are known to be deceptive even by ordinary worldly consciousness are merely conventional but not conventional truths appears to be a statement made without understanding the definitive number of the two truths, the true and false in relation to worldly perspective, and the true and false as established by Madhyamikas.
Even when it is said that the true nature does not appear at all to those with ignorance, since it is accepted that noble beings who have not abandoned ignorance can directly realize suchness, this refers to consciousness that is corrupted by ignorance. The post-meditation wisdom of noble beings in training and the views of suchness held by ordinary beings are corrupted by ignorance and its latent tendencies, so although they do not appear directly, ultimate truth must be accepted as appearing in general. Thus, for the time being, as included in the links of existence, due to afflictive ignorance, conventional truth is established. When it is said this way, the ignorance that grasps phenomena as truly existent, known as the self-grasping of persons and phenomena, is considered to be the ignorance of the twelve links, and is therefore not considered to be cognitive obscuration.
When it says that conventional truth is established by the power of ignorance (that grasps at true existence), this shows how conventional truth is posited in relation to what consciousness. It does not mean that the ignorance grasping at true existence establishes things like pots and woolen cloth that are conventionally true, because what is established by such grasping at true existence is held to be impossible even conventionally.$$Therefore, many people seem to confuse the meaning because of the similar terminology between the "conventional" in relation to which truth is established in the phrase "conventional truth" and the "conventional" in the context of establishing the conventional existence of things like pots. These should be carefully distinguished.
If asked whether these things like vases are conventionally true for all beings who have not attained enlightenment, or whether they are conventionally untrue for some beings:$$Forms, sounds, and so forth that are established as conventional truths are seen as artificial phenomena (like reflections and mirages) by Hearers, Solitary Realizers, and Bodhisattvas who have abandoned the ignorance of afflictive emotions. For them, these are of an artificial nature and not true, because they have no conception of them as being true.$$To explain this meaning: There are three types of beings for whom things are not true: Hearers, Solitary Realizers, and Bodhisattvas.
Moreover, the specific distinction that is made regarding both Śrāvakas-Pratyekabuddhas and Bodhisattvas is this: While all conditioned phenomena are empty of inherent existence like reflections, one special quality is the direct realization of their appearance as such. Since this level of realization is also present in Bodhisattvas up to the seventh ground and in noble Śrāvaka learners, to exclude them, it is taught that "the third type of person has abandoned ignorance." This refers to Bodhisattvas in the pure grounds and Arhat Śrāvakas-Pratyekabuddhas - it is not true from the perspective of these three.
Whatever is unreal refers to all outer and inner phenomena. The reason for their unreality is the conception of truth, because there is no attachment to truth, since ignorance that grasps at true existence has been exhausted. Therefore, this establishes that all outer and inner phenomena are not truly established even conventionally for those three types of persons.
In this way, while the commentary proves that these are not true (in ultimate reality), rather than proving they are not conventionally true from their perspective, to hold that it proves they are not conventionally true is a poor tradition of explaining the master's intent by contaminating it with one's own mental impurities due to an extremely coarse understanding.
Such establishment is not for those three types of individuals, but rather it is established for other individuals like ourselves for whom it is not true from the perspective of those three. For those lower than these three types of individuals, since they possess innate grasping at true existence, one cannot establish that nothing exists truly from the perspective of all their conventional [cognitions].
If one tries to prove that what was explained earlier is not the case and that these are not conventional truths from their perspective, it would become an entirely irrelevant proof. Since for something to be established as conventionally true from the perspective of that mind, that basis must be established as false, to present the absence of grasping at its truth as a reason is a matter of ridicule.
The reason why, for that awareness, the basis must be established as false in order to establish it as conventional truth is this: When positing the "truth" part in the term "conventional truth" for things like vases, between consciousness and object, it is not posited as truth in terms of the object. Rather, seeing that it must be posited as truth in terms of the conventional grasping at true existence, one must see that without applying that qualification, it cannot be established as truth and must be seen as false. This is the key point.
Secondly, it appears important to understand that in this tradition, there is a unique identification of afflictive emotions (kleśas) that differs from what is explained in both the higher and lower Abhidharma texts. To explain this: regarding grasping at true existence of phenomena, there are two types - grasping at the true existence of persons and grasping at the true existence of phenomena. As previously explained, these are also considered as the two types of self-grasping.
In both the Madhyamakavatara Commentary and the Commentary on the Four Hundred Verses, grasping at true existence is explained as afflictive ignorance. This ignorance is said to be abandoned by Arhats of the Hearers and Solitary Realizers, and according to the Commentary on the Four Hundred Verses, it is also abandoned by Bodhisattvas who have attained the acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena. Therefore, afflictive ignorance is the opposite of understanding the ultimate reality of selflessness. This is not merely the absence of such understanding or something different from it, but rather it is the contradictory opposite that superimposes inherent existence onto persons and phenomena.
Thus, establishing the reification of dharmas as self as afflictive ignorance, and establishing both the conception of 'I' and 'mine' as inherently existent as the view of the transitory collection - these are inconsistent with the Abhidharmikas' position.
According to the Abhidharma tradition, as explained in the ninth chapter of the Treasury of Knowledge Commentary (Abhidharmakośa-bhāṣya), the view of self-identity that grasps at the person as a self-sufficient substantial entity is the self-grasping view of identity, while grasping at possessions as being controlled by that substantially existent person is established as the self-grasping view of mine/possession. These are extremely contradictory [to reality].
Although the conception of a person as a substantially existent, self-sufficient entity exists even in minds not influenced by philosophical tenets, the conception of a person as existing separately with characteristics different from the aggregates does not exist in minds not influenced by philosophical tenets. Thus, there are two types of extreme views.
If one holds the position that persons and phenomena exist through their own characteristics, how can we establish that such conceptions are both afflictive ignorance and the two types of self-grasping? When persons and phenomena are proven to not exist inherently through logical reasoning that refutes such existence, then such conceptions are established as true-grasping that is mistaken about its object of fixation. Once this is established, grasping at the true existence of both persons and phenomena is established as the two types of self-grasping. When these are established, this true-grasping is proven to be ignorance because it is the opposing factor that contradicts the understanding of reality (suchness). Moreover, since one can prove that the view of the transitory collection cannot be eliminated as long as this ignorance remains, it is established as afflictive ignorance. Therefore, it is extremely important to understand how to establish this unique presentation of afflictions.
Regarding how other afflictions such as desire arise from the ignorance of grasping at true existence: As stated in the Four Hundred Verses, "Just as the physical senses depend on the body, ignorance dwells within all [afflictions]." According to its commentary: "Because ignorance is deluded about how things truly exist, it actively engages in superimposing a truly existent inherent nature onto phenomena."
As stated: "Since attachment and other [afflictions] engage in superimposing distinctions of pleasant and unpleasant onto the very nature of things that are merely conceptually constructed by ignorance, they function inseparably from ignorance and also depend on ignorance, because ignorance is primary." When explained this way, up to where it says "they engage," this shows that ignorance is grasping at true existence.
Attachment and other [afflictions] operate inseparably from ignorance, meaning they function in conjunction with ignorance and do not operate when separated from it. The reason for this is that attachment and other [afflictions] function precisely because [of ignorance]. Regarding this, the mental fabrication of objects as attractive or unattractive is the cause for generating both attachment and aversion through improper mental attention, but this is not showing the mode of apprehension of attachment and aversion. Therefore, [when the text says] "only on what is conceptualized by ignorance," it means that both attachment and aversion operate in dependence on the mental fabrication of inherently existent attractiveness and unattractiveness.
It is not taught that true existence imputed by ignorance alone is the object among the two aspects (object and aspect) of attachment and other afflictions. This is because the objects of both aspects of the two innate self-grasping [attitudes] are established bases, and since attachment and other [afflictions] are also concomitant with ignorance, their objects are similar.
The aspects of desire and aversion that arise from improper mental attention to objects - namely, the aspect of wanting and the aspect of turning away from what is unwanted - become attachment and hatred. However, merely having aspects of wanting and not wanting that stem from grasping at persons as inherently self-sufficient entities is not what establishes attachment and aversion. Therefore, the way attachment and hatred are established differs.
As for the phrase "it also depends on ignorance," this means that attachment and other [afflictions] are drawn forth due to the precedence of ignorance that grasps at inherent existence (self-nature).
Using the example of the body faculty in relation to the body: Just as the other four faculties have no separate physical basis apart from the body faculty, similarly all other afflictions operate in dependence on ignorance and function inseparably from it. Therefore, by destroying ignorance alone, all afflictions will be destroyed. Thus, it is taught that one should respectfully attend to the teaching of emptiness - that dependent origination is devoid of inherent existence - as this serves as the antidote to ignorance.
The grasping at true existence of phenomena is taught in "Seventy Verses on Emptiness" as the root ignorance of samsara. Also, in "Sixty Verses on Reasoning" it states: "If one finds any basis whatsoever, they will be caught by the deceptive venomous snake of afflictions. Those whose minds have no basis will not be caught." This teaches that if one finds any reference point of grasping at true existence, they will be caught by the snake of afflictions. Furthermore, immediately following that, it states: "For those whose minds have a basis, how can the great poison of afflictions not arise?" This is the supreme intention of the Noble One [Nagarjuna].
In connecting the last two lines, it is taught that for those who perceive the nature of form and other phenomena yet wish to abandon afflictions, it is impossible to abandon afflictions. As stated in the later commentary: When there is grasping at real existence, the vast afflictions like attachment cannot be reversed. How so? First, if that object is agreeable to the mind, then at that time attachment to it is difficult to reverse. If it is disagreeable, then at that time anger and irritation towards it are difficult to reverse. Furthermore, the commentary states that even for objects that are neither pleasant nor unpleasant, ignorance arises. When one's mindstream is engaged in grasping at objects as inherently existent by their own characteristics, either attachment or aversion will arise, and even when these two do not arise, similar types of delusion will engage.
From the Bodhicharyavatara (The Way of the Bodhisattva): "A mind with objects and attachments will remain fixed on certain things. Like a mind devoid of emptiness, once ceased, will arise again - just like the meditative absorption without perception." This indicates that regarding this aspect, there is no difference in how these two masters and Buddhapalita - all three of them - interpret the noble one's (Nagarjuna's) intent.
Through this key point, the explanation that one can achieve nirvana merely through the path of the sixteen aspects (such as impermanence) is interpretative. The identifications of afflictions made in terms of that path are also incomplete. Based on these, one can also understand pride and other afflictions. Regarding the unique ignorance, view of personal identity, and extreme views, both the intellectually acquired and innate forms should be understood. I have not written more details for fear of being too verbose.
Similarly, just as the conceptual thoughts that grasp phenomena as truly existent are divided into nine levels of afflictions to be abandoned through meditation (from great to medium), and these are paired with nine antidotes on the path of meditation, and just as the conceptual thoughts that grasp subject and object as substantially different are divided into nine levels of afflictions to be abandoned through meditation (from great to medium), and these are paired with nine antidotes on the path of meditation - this should be understood as interpretable meaning taught temporarily for the sake of certain disciples who are not yet capable of fully realizing both the subtle and coarse selflessness of phenomena.
Secondly, these phenomena appear to ordinary beings as having inherent existence when they do not, and thus deceive them. However, for the three types of individuals mentioned earlier who are different from these [ordinary beings], because phenomena are dependent originations that are fabricated, they are merely conventional and not ultimately true.
Moreover, since only the non-afflictive ignorance characterized as cognitive obscurations operates, it appears to noble beings who are in the post-meditation state experiencing appearances contaminated by ignorance and its latent tendencies. However, it does not appear to noble beings who are in meditative equipoise, who have the sphere of activity free from appearances. $$If asked what this system considers as cognitive obscurations, it is as stated in the Commentary on Entering the Middle Way: "There, the latent tendencies of ignorance are obstacles to completely understanding objects of knowledge, while the existence of latent tendencies of attachment and so forth are also causes for such physical and verbal engagement. These latent tendencies of ignorance and attachment, etc., are eliminated only in the Omniscient One, the Buddha, but not in others."$$This refers to physical and verbal activities present in Arhats, such as jumping like monkeys and using terms like "old woman" to others - habitual patterns of inappropriate physical and verbal conduct that persisted even when prohibited by the Buddha.
Furthermore, it is taught that the habitual tendencies of attachment and so forth are obstacles to understanding objects of knowledge. The habitual tendencies of afflictive emotions are cognitive obscurations, and all aspects of their result - dualistic deluded appearances - are also included within that category.
Among the two types - the habitual tendencies that are seeds of afflictions and the habitual tendencies that are not seeds of afflictions - the latter constitutes cognitive obscurations. Even when all seeds of afflictions are exhausted and grasping at true existence no longer arises, due to being influenced by habitual tendencies, deluded cognition regarding appearances still arises.
Since the noble ones who have not yet become Buddhas have not abandoned cognitive obscurations and ignorance, they alternate between conceptual appearances during post-meditation and non-appearance during meditative equipoise. However, since the Buddhas have completely and perfectly awakened to both the ultimate and conventional aspects of all phenomena, and because all movements of conceptual thoughts of mind and mental factors have completely ceased, they do not alternate between the presence and absence of conceptual appearances during meditative equipoise and post-meditation.
The word "permanent" indicates that for other noble ones, meditative equipoise is occasional. Therefore, there is an alternation between meditative equipoise and post-meditation. Thus, the phrase "because cognitive obscurations and ignorance are active" is not the reason for the existence of appearances, but rather serves as proof that appearances alternately exist and don't exist during meditative equipoise and post-meditation.
The movements of mind and mental factors are considered to be conceptual thoughts. As stated in the Prasannapadā: "Since conceptual thought is the movement of mind, and because [ultimate reality] is free from that, suchness itself is free from conceptual elaboration. As it is said in the sutra: 'What is ultimate truth? It is that where there is not even movement of mind, so what need is there to mention letters?'"
Third, whatever is ultimate truth for ordinary beings is merely conventional truth for noble ones who operate with appearances. And the emptiness which is the nature of that [conventional truth] is their ultimate truth. The meaning of the first part of this statement is: What ordinary beings grasp as ultimately established, such as pots and so forth, is merely conventional for the three types of noble ones in their post-meditation state when appearances arise after emerging from meditative equipoise, as previously explained. This indicates that for those noble ones, it only negates being truly existent, but does not negate being conventionally true. It does not indicate that the referent object that ordinary beings grasp as ultimately established in pots and so forth becomes conventional for noble ones, because that is impossible.
The meaning of the latter text is: While dependent origination is conventional by nature, when it reveals the true nature of phenomena to the noble ones as ultimate truth, a single basis like a vase is conventional in relation to ordinary beings and ultimate in relation to noble ones. Those who speak contrary to the text by reversing it fail to understand that whatever appears as conventional truth to a particular mind must be negated as truth from that same perspective.
The ultimate truth of all Buddhas is their very nature itself, and because it is free from deception, it is the ultimate truth, which is to be individually realized by them through self-cognition.
The word "itself" (nyid) in the phrase "is the nature itself" is an emphatic particle, and what it excludes is this: unlike other noble ones' ultimate truth which is established as non-appearing nature in meditative equipoise and appearing nature in post-meditation, [Buddha's ultimate truth] is the dharmatā (true nature) that remains constantly equipoised in its nature at all times.
The meaning of "that also" and so forth is: In order to show that ultimate truth is not truly established, it is explained that the meaning of truth is that which exists without deception from the perspective of seeing suchness.
Second, there are two parts: explaining the meaning of the root text and dispelling objections to it. First, wishing to teach ultimate truth, since ultimate truth cannot be expressed in words and is not an object of knowledge that follows such words, it cannot be directly taught. Therefore, to clarify its nature for those who wish to hear it, an example is given that ordinary beings can experience themselves.$$As stated, the meaning of being beyond the realm of expression and knowledge is that it cannot be directly taught. This is also found in Nag-tsho's translation as "cannot be directly demonstrated."$$The meaning of this is explained in the Clear Words Commentary on the statement that the nature of reality cannot be known from others: Just as when someone with cataracts sees the false appearance of floating hairs and such, even if someone without cataracts tries to show them, they cannot understand the true nature of the absence of floating hairs as seen by those without cataracts. Similarly, while the listener may not understand it in that way, this does not mean they cannot understand the absence of floating hairs at all.$$Using this example for teaching the nature of reality: although one may not understand it exactly as seen by those free from the distortion of ignorance's cataracts, this does not mean one cannot understand the nature of reality at all. Therefore, ultimate truth is not something that cannot be expressed through definitive scriptures with profound meaning and words that teach such meaning, nor is it something that cannot be understood by the mind that follows such teachings. This same principle should be understood for all statements about the nature of reality being beyond the realm of expression and knowledge.
When someone with impaired vision, due to the power of their visual disturbance, sees what appears to be hair strands, flies, and such things inside their drinking vessel made of rhinoceros horn or similar material, they misidentify the actual nature of these apparent hair strands and flies. Upon examining them more closely and wishing to remove them, they repeatedly shake and turn the vessel, experiencing the trouble of doing so.
When one with clear vision without eye disease goes near them and looks at the very place where they saw those hair strands and such, even upon focusing their gaze, they do not observe those appearances of hair strands, nor do they conceptualize any qualities dependent on or characterized by those hair strands. Furthermore, when someone with eye disease tells someone without eye disease "I see hair strands," expressing their own thoughts, then wishing to dispel the misconceptions of the one with eye disease, speaking from their perspective, although they may emphatically state words of negation saying "There are no hair strands here," the speaker is not denying the existence of hair strands.
The true nature of the hair strands seen by one with blurred vision is what is seen by one without blurred vision, not what is seen by the one with blurred vision. Similarly, understand these two examples in this context. The way to understand is this: Those whose minds are corrupted by the impairment of ignorance's blurred vision and who do not see reality as it is - their perception of the inherent nature of aggregates, elements, and sense bases is conventional, like someone with blurred vision perceiving falling hair strands.
Due to not seeing the true nature of the aggregates and so forth, those objects of perception - just as someone with clear vision (without eye disease) does not see floating hairs - the way in which the Buddhas, who are free from the cognitive obscurations of habitual ignorance, perceive the nature of the aggregates and so forth, that object of their perception is the ultimate truth of those Buddhas.
Secondly, if just as a healthy eye without visual impairment does not see even the mere appearance of floating hairs, similarly if the Buddha does not perceive the conventional aggregates and so forth that appear to minds corrupted by ignorance, then these would become non-existent. This is because if they existed, the Buddha would necessarily perceive them.
If conventional phenomena like aggregates did not exist, then attaining Buddhahood would also be impossible, since individuals who first generate bodhicitta are affected by ignorance. If one explains how this fault does not exist: There are two ways in which Buddha's wisdom knows objects of knowledge - the way of knowing all ultimate truth objects of knowledge, and the way of knowing all conventional truth objects of knowledge. Regarding the first: It knows the true nature of conventional appearances like aggregates through the mode of not seeing them.
Secondly, since inferential cognition without direct perception cannot be attributed to a Buddha, objects must be known through direct perception. Therefore, with respect to the wisdom that knows the extent of all phenomena (conventional wisdom), objects are known through the mode of appearance where there is a duality of subject and object.
Although the Buddha's knowledge of the extent of phenomena is not tainted by the latent imprints of ignorance and thus does not perceive aggregates and so forth, the Buddha must perceive what appears to other beings' minds that are tainted by ignorance. This is because such appearances cannot be non-existent, and if these conventional truths exist, they must be cognized by the Buddha's knowledge of the extent of phenomena.
Although visual consciousness free from eye disease does not perceive the falling hairs that appear to those with eye disease, since the non-appearance of those [hairs] is not necessary, it is unlike [the state of] a Buddha.
As long as the habitual tendencies of dualistic delusion are not exhausted, the direct perception of ultimate reality (things as they are) and conventional reality (things as they appear) cannot arise simultaneously as one essence. Therefore, they must be perceived alternately in meditation and post-meditation. Thus, these two cannot be perceived within a single moment of primordial wisdom. When the habitual tendencies of delusion are completely eliminated, the two wisdoms arise as one essence in each moment of primordial wisdom without interruption. Therefore, there is no need for alternation between perceiving and not perceiving the two types of knowable objects simultaneously. Thus, there is no contradiction with the statement that "Even in a single moment of omniscient wisdom, it pervades the entire mandala of knowable objects."
Although the two wisdoms are of the same essence, there is not even the slightest contradiction in having two different ways of knowing in relation to two different objects. This is a unique quality of the Buddha Bhagavan alone. However, some consider only the way of knowing ultimate reality as Buddha's wisdom and claim that the wisdom of knowing conventional phenomena does not exist in Buddha's mind-stream but is included in the disciples' mind-streams - thereby denigrating Buddha's wisdom of knowing conventional phenomena. Some others appear to denigrate both wisdoms by claiming that even the wisdom of knowing ultimate reality does not exist in Buddha's mind-stream. The remaining points will be explained in the section on the result.
If all dualistic appearances subside, isn't such a nature non-seeing? Therefore, how do those Buddhas see ultimate truth? While it is true that in their direct perception of suchness, they do not see in a dualistic way because dualistic appearances have subsided, nevertheless, it is said that they see through the mode of non-seeing. The way this addresses the objection is: because the wisdom that knows things as they are directly perceives the suchness of aggregates and so forth; because the non-establishment of aggregates and so forth in that perspective is their suchness; and because their suchness must be seen through the mode of not seeing the aggregates and so forth. As stated in the auto-commentary: "Without contacting conditioned phenomena, by directly realizing only the natural state, they comprehend suchness itself, and therefore are called Buddhas." This means that the Buddha's wisdom that knows ultimate truth comprehends only the true nature without contacting phenomenal objects, which is equivalent to saying that they see the suchness of things through the mode of not seeing the aggregates and so forth.
The meaning of the statement "not seeing is supreme seeing" is not intended to mean that seeing nothing is seeing. Rather, as explained before, not seeing elaborations is established as seeing freedom from elaborations; thus, seeing and not seeing do not refer to the same basis.$$As stated in the Samcayagatha:$"Not seeing forms, not seeing feelings,$Not seeing perceptions, not seeing mental formations,$Where there is no seeing of consciousness, mind, and mentality,$This is seeing the Dharma, as taught by the Tathagata.$When beings speak of 'seeing space,'$How is space seen? Examine this.$Similarly, seeing the Dharma is taught by the Tathagata;$This seeing cannot be explained by any other example."$$Here, 'not seeing' refers to the five aggregates, and 'seeing' refers to the Dharma, which is the meaning of suchness (tathata). As it is taught, "Whoever sees dependent origination sees the Dharma."
Furthermore, for example, space is merely the absence of tangible obstruction. Seeing or realizing space is similar to recognizing the absence of something that would be perceptible if obstructing matter were present. In that case too, the visible space and the invisible are [distinguished by] obstruction. Similarly, just as one sees blue but not non-blue, the final line refutes that ultimate reality is seen in the same way as one sees blue.
From "Entry into the Two Truths," as evidence of seeing by way of not seeing: "Divine child, if ultimately the ultimate truth were to become the nature of objects of body, speech, and mind, then it would not count as what is called 'ultimate truth' - it would become conventional truth instead."
However, divine child, ultimately the ultimate truth transcends all conventions. It is undifferentiated, unborn, unceasing, and free from what is to be expressed and expression, what is to be known and knowing. The meaning of the earlier sutra that is quoted is this: When perceiving ultimate truth from the perspective of seeing the ultimate, it is not seen in a way that fails to see conventional phenomena like aggregates. Rather, if it were to become an object like the physical and verbal objects of activity and mental objects, then from the perspective of directly seeing suchness, it would not be free from elaborations and thus would not be ultimate truth but would become conventional elaboration. When understood this way, this serves as evidence that it is seen in the manner of not being seen.
The meaning of the second sutra is that, from the perspective of directly perceiving ultimate truth, ultimate truth is undifferentiated, meaning there are not many different distinguishing characteristics. The other three are easy to understand.
In that state of seeing, it is easy to be free from the activities of speech and action.
Although the wisdom that directly perceives suchness can be established as the ultimate knowing consciousness and ultimate truth can be established as its object of knowledge, it is not contradictory that in the perspective of that wisdom, it is free from the duality of subject and object. This is because the duality of subject and object is established only from the perspective of conventional consciousness. For example, just as logical inferential cognition can be established as the subject and ultimate truth as its object, yet the duality of subject and object is not established from the perspective of reasoning consciousness. Then, divine child, ultimate truth transcends even being an object of omniscient wisdom possessing all supreme aspects. It is not as it is conventionally expressed when we say "ultimate truth."
All phenomena are false and deceptive. The meaning of this quote is to show how ultimate truth transcends even the object of omniscient wisdom. The way it transcends is explained as follows: When one speaks of "this is ultimate truth," in the conceptual mind that follows the words, it appears as a duality of subject and object. However, for the omniscient one who knows things as they are, it transcends such appearances because all dual-appearing phenomena are false and deceptive. In the perspective of one who sees only the non-deceptive suchness, such duality does not exist.$$This is the source explaining that in the direct perception of suchness, conventional phenomena like aggregates do not appear. Therefore, in the perspective of direct perception of suchness, all conceptual elaborations of duality such as existence and non-existence are impossible, because the inherent nature of these elaborations is not observed there.$$Thus, regarding the contemplation of suchness, only the noble ones are directly valid authorities. Those who are not noble ones are not direct valid authorities. Therefore, the refutation of external production from the perspective of the noble ones' ultimate wisdom cannot be contradicted by worldly conventions.
Fourth, if one wishes to raise worldly objections to the ultimate refutation of production from other, then if one accepts conventional worldly perception as valid in the context of analyzing ultimate reality, consider this: If worldly perception were valid for understanding ultimate reality, then ordinary worldspeople would directly perceive ultimate reality naturally. Since this would have been the case since beginningless time, one would have to accept that ignorance has been eliminated. In that case, what need would there be for noble beings or for seeking the noble path? There would be no need. However, ordinary foolish worldly people cannot be valid authorities regarding ultimate reality. Therefore, in the context of analyzing ultimate reality, because worldly perception is not valid in any way regarding ultimate reality, there can be no worldly objections in the context of ultimate reality. When it is stated that "worldly perception is not valid in any way," some claim this shows this system rejects all valid cognition and is therefore incorrect, while others praise this position - but both groups speak without understanding the master's intent, merely revealing their own views. This is because they misunderstand the statement that worldly perception is not valid in any way regarding ultimate reality as meaning valid cognition is rejected altogether.
As explained in the Prasannapadā, having refuted inherent existence of valid cognition and objects of knowledge, one must establish valid cognition and objects of knowledge as dependently designated, as will be explained below.
Fifth: If one asks, "How does the world refute [this]?" When someone negates what is established and known in the world itself through worldly convention, then that person will be refuted by the world. For example, if someone says "My substance was stolen," and another person asks "What was that substance?" and the first person replies "A vase," and then the other person tries to refute this by saying "A vase is not a substance because it is an object of measurement, like a vase in a dream" - in such cases and similar instances, the world refutes such arguments. However, when one relies on the noble ones' ultimate vision and establishes the true nature of reality by taking as authority those beings who are skilled in ultimate truth, then there is no refutation by the world.
When scholars say "one should analyze other cases in this way," it refers to refuting those who currently consider themselves great Madhyamika logicians who make claims such as: "I am not the owner of the pot and Devadatta is not the thief," and when asked "what grew?" after stating "it grew in my field," they reply "a sprout," and then argue "the sprout does not arise because it is an object of valid cognition," using examples like "like a person in a dream and a sprout." These positions are shown to be contradicted by conventional worldly understanding.
Second, having thus accepted production from other in accordance with worldly convention and having eliminated worldly refutation, now since there is no production from other even in worldly perception, while remaining within the worldly view, there is no worldly refutation of the wish to negate production from other. This is what is being explained.
For what reason do worldly people, when indicating someone with male organs, say "I produced this son"? Although they say this, it is not the case that the father takes out a being with male organs from his own body and places it in the mother's womb. What then? He merely deposits impure substances that become the seed of that son's body into the mother's womb.
Because a father deposits the physical cause into [the womb] and reveals his own son, therefore the seed and the son are not held to be inherently established as separate entities in their own characteristics. This is clearly established in the conventional world. Therefore, even in the conventional world, there is no conception of production from other regarding the impure seed and the son, or the grain seed and its sprout, and so forth.
If one were to grasp at inherent existence, then when showing another person's child, one would not be able to say "I produced this." Similarly, when merely planting a tree seed and a tree grows from it, one thinks "I planted this tree." Therefore, from the worldly perspective, there is no production from other, etc., as explained before. Although the planted seeds are neither the tree nor the child, when the tree and child arise in dependence upon planting those seeds, one can point to them and establish "I produced this." This is like how even though a sick or healed hand is not the person themselves, when the hand is sick or healed, one can establish that person as being sick or healed.
Although there is no production from other in conventional worldly terms, the existence of production from other cannot be refuted merely by worldly perception. This is because refuting the inherently distinct nature between cause and effect necessarily depends on reasoning that analyzes ultimate reality. Therefore, when other philosophical schools assert production from other, they mean production from other that is established by its own characteristics, not merely being established as different entities. And it's not that even this much is not established from a worldly perspective.
The meaning of "There is no production from other even in the conventional world" is not merely stating that in ordinary worldly understanding, there is no conception of cause and effect (like seeds and sprouts) as inherently established "others." Rather, it should be understood as teaching that there is no production from other even at the conventional level. As explained in the commentary refuting production from both [self and other]: "Just as it was shown earlier that production from self and other is unreasonable both conventionally and ultimately, similarly for those who assert both positions, it is impossible according to the reasoning previously explained." This clearly states that there is no production from other even at the conventional level.
From the Prasannapadā (Clear Words): "If things do not arise from self, other, both, or without cause, then how did the Blessed One teach 'From the condition of ignorance arise formations'?" In response to this, it is explained: "This is conventional truth, not ultimate truth." Thus, it is taught that the production of formations by ignorance and so forth exists only conventionally, not ultimately.
In response to the question "Should we explain the conventional framework?", [the text] clearly states that we accept the establishment of conventions merely through this dependent origination, but not through accepting the four alternatives. Even when accepting arising through dependent origination conventionally - 'this arises in dependence on these conditions' - it does not accept arising through the four alternatives. Therefore, the claim that "this system does not refute other-arising even conventionally" is an explanation by those who have not properly understood this system.
Third, as explained earlier regarding how things do not exist inherently by their own nature, to demonstrate the quality of not falling into the extremes of eternalism and nihilism through establishing dependent origination as free from eternalism and nihilism, it is explained:$$If a sprout were inherently different from its seed, then since the seed and sprout could not be cause and effect, without doubt, even while the sprout exists, the continuity of the seed would be severed. This is because when seed and sprout become unrelated, even though the sprout exists, it does not help maintain the unbroken lineage of the seed. For example, just as the existence of a non-cow does not help prevent the lineage of cows from being cut off after a cow dies, and just as the existence of ordinary beings does not help prevent the noble ones from cutting off their own cyclic existence.
Given this is the case, for the reason that a sprout is not inherently established as different from its seed, these two are not contradictory as cause and effect. Therefore, when the sprout exists, the seed has disintegrated - and by the discontinuation of its continuity, the extreme of annihilation is avoided.
Since it has been explained many times that the seed ceases at the time of the sprout, the commentaries explain that the meaning of "destruction of the seed" refers to the discontinuation of the seed's continuum, and since it is stated that the indestructibility of the seed is refuted, it is understood that "discontinuation of the seed's continuum" means the cutting off of its lineage.
Because the seed and sprout do not exist as one entity, and since that seed does not transform into the sprout, therefore when the sprout exists, the non-destruction of the seed is negated. For this reason also, one should not say that the seed exists at the time of the sprout, thus permanence is also negated. This is explained in the Lalitavistara Sutra:$$"When there is a seed, there is a sprout accordingly,$Yet what is the seed is not identical to the sprout.$It's neither different from it nor the same as it,$Thus is the nature of dharmas - neither permanent nor annihilated."$$The meaning of this is that when there is a seed, the sprout that is caused by the seed arises accordingly. When it arises, since it cannot arise as completely different from the seed, one might think the seed and sprout are one in essence. However, although the sprout does not arise as different from the seed, the seed itself does not transform into the sprout. Why? Because the sprout is neither inherently different from the seed nor inherently the same as it. When both these positions are negated, the nature of the sprout is shown to be free from both permanence and annihilation.$$This very meaning is explained in that same sutra:$$"Conditioned phenomena depend on ignorance as their condition,$These conditioned things do not exist in ultimate reality.$Both conditioned things and ignorance are empty,$Free from inherent movement by nature."$$The first line shows the logical reason that conditioned phenomena arise in dependence on ignorance. The second line shows what is to be proved - that conditioned phenomena do not exist ultimately. The third line shows that both cause and effect are empty. The fourth line shows how they are empty - movement means active conditioning, and being free from that means conditioned phenomena are empty of conditioning.
Furthermore, showing the specific object of negation as "being devoid of inherent existence," which is equivalent to saying "does not exist ultimately." The meaning of this sutra is also expressed in the treatise Mulamadhyamakakarika (Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way), which states: "Whatever arises dependently is neither identical to that upon which it depends, nor is it different from it. Therefore, it is neither permanent nor annihilated."
The fourth has two parts: refuting the assertion that things exist through their own characteristics, and dispelling objections to that refutation. The first has three parts: refutation through the consequence that noble ones' meditative equipoise would destroy phenomena; refutation through the consequence that conventional truth would withstand logical analysis; and refutation through the consequence that ultimate production would not be negated. $$For the first: As stated, "The fact that no phenomena whatsoever arise through inherent nature must necessarily be accepted." Thus, it is appropriate to say that this point must definitely be accepted, rather than saying the opposite - that it is not appropriate to accept this position.
That is not so. If the characteristics of form, feeling, and so forth - their inherent nature established by their own essence - were to arise in dependence on causes and conditions, then when yogis directly realize that phenomena are empty of inherent existence, they would realize emptiness in a way that negates the actual nature of things. This is because in meditative equipoise, forms and so forth must be unobserved, and if they were established by their own characteristics, they would have to be observed in meditative equipoise, but they are not observed. At that time, those things would become non-existent. If they are non-existent, then those things that existed before meditative equipoise would later become non-existent, meaning they would be destroyed. Therefore, since meditative equipoise itself would have to be the cause of such destruction, just as a hammer and such are causes for destroying a vase and such things, the perception of emptiness would become a cause for destroying the nature of things and negating it. Since this is not logical, the establishment of things by their own characteristics does not exist. Therefore, at all times, one should not accept arising through inherent existence.
Regarding this, some Madhyamikas who accept inherently existent production claim that even though things are inherently established, they don't become ultimately real. Based on this reasoning, they assert that if form and other phenomena were inherently established, they wouldn't need to be perceived by direct realization of suchness. However, as explained before and will be explained again through reasoning, from that very point things would be ultimately real, and they cannot avoid this fault.
From the commentary here, as quoted from the Ratnakuta Sutra where Kashyapa states that the Middle Way's proper individual analysis of phenomena is: "Emptiness does not make phenomena empty; phenomena themselves are empty." Similarly, it is stated regarding signlessness, wishlessness, non-composition, non-arising, and non-occurrence. This shows that if phenomena had an inherent nature established by their own characteristics, then since these phenomena would not be empty from their own side, the statement "phenomena themselves are empty" would be incorrect. And if their inherent existence from their own side is not negated, then they would need to be shown as empty through being empty of something else, which would contradict the statement "emptiness does not make phenomena empty." Therefore, when the Middle Way path analyzes the nature of phenomena individually, it teaches that phenomena are empty of inherent existence from their own side.
This sutra refutes both the Mind-Only school's assertion that dependent nature is not empty of intrinsic existence, and their claim that it is empty of subject-object duality as separate substances. As stated in the Śataka:$$"Neither seeing as non-empty nor as possessing emptiness,$'May I personally attain nirvana' - $The Tathagatas have taught that with such wrong views,$One cannot pass beyond sorrow."$$And as Nagarjuna states in the Mulamadhyamakakarika:$$"The Victorious Ones have declared$That emptiness is the relinquishing of all views.$Those who hold emptiness as a view$Are declared to be incurable."$$These verses explain the same meaning as the earlier sutra.
The meaning of "phenomena are empty of their own nature" is just that. It is completely incorrect to say that "a vase being empty of true existence (while not being empty of itself) is other-emptiness, whereas a vase being empty of itself is self-emptiness." If a vase were empty of itself, then the vase would have to lack its own nature. If something lacks its own nature, it cannot exist for others either, so the vase would become completely non-existent. In that case, all other phenomena would be similar, and even the one making such statements would become non-existent. Then it would be impossible to make any distinctions about what is empty of what and what is not empty of what. While some claim this kind of emptiness is authentic, and others consider it nihilistic emptiness, both views deviate from what the Buddha and Bodhisattvas have repeatedly established - that dependent origination is free from the extremes of eternalism and nihilism.
Particularly, regarding the claim that all conventional truths must be established as empty of themselves, considering this as a nihilistic emptiness is completely incorrect. This is because none of the four philosophical schools, knowing this view to be nihilistic, would cultivate it in their own mindstream.$$Therefore, while both the absence of the basis of negation as the nature of what is being negated and the way that basis is empty of what is being negated are similar in being empty, the emptiness of phenomena being established by their own characteristics means being empty of inherent existence. The reason why other ways of being empty are not emptiness of inherent existence is that: while the former type of emptiness, once established by valid cognition and its function remains intact, cannot possibly give rise to philosophical misconceptions that grasp the basis as truly existent or existing as its own reality; with the latter types, even though their meaning is established by valid cognition and their function remains intact, it's still possible to superimpose true existence or existence as its own reality through philosophical views.
Second, it is said here: Although ultimately there is no arising and thus it is crucial to refute arising from self and other, those objects perceived by the two valid cognitions such as form and feeling must necessarily arise from other. If this is not accepted, why speak of two truths? There would only be one truth. Therefore, they claim that arising from other exists.
Thus, those who argue appear to accept that there is no arising ultimately, while conventionally accepting other-arising - these are some Svātantrika Madhyamikas.
If one does not accept dependent origination as conventional truth, it would result in only one truth. This means that if there is no inherent existence at the conventional level, there would be no valid conventional truth, and at that time, since conventional truth would be impossible, there would only be ultimate truth. In response to this, although this is true, ultimately there are not two truths. As stated [in scripture]: "Monks, there is only one ultimate truth - that is, the non-deceptive nature of nirvana."
Since it is said that "All conditioned phenomena are false and deceptive in nature," the meaning of these [teachings] is that the truth which one accepts is non-deceptive, and therefore becomes solely the non-deceptive truth, thus it is said "this here is indeed true."
From the ultimate perspective, that is, from the viewpoint of seeing reality as it is (tathātā), the two truths - conventional and ultimate - do not exist [as separate]. This is because from that perspective, only the ultimate truth is taught to exist alone. The supreme truth is the ultimate truth. The fact that conventional truth does not exist from the perspective of that wisdom is understood because it is taught to be of a deceptive nature.
In summary, if phenomena were established by their own characteristics, compounded phenomena could not be established as false and deceptive in nature. Therefore, since conventional truth would not exist, the two truths would become non-existent. However, from the perspective where there is no establishment by own characteristics, both conventional and ultimate truths exist - this is the meaning.
If one thinks: "Based on the previous scripture which states that only nirvana is true while other conditioned phenomena are false, although conditioned phenomena are not established by their own characteristics, isn't nirvana, as the ultimate truth, established by its own characteristics?" The truth of nirvana is explained in the sutra itself as being "possessing the quality of non-deception," so it is explained as truth in the sense of being non-deceptive, but not as truth in the sense of being inherently established.
Since it is said that "all conditioned phenomena are false and deceptive in nature," one should understand this in relation to the earlier [teaching about] truth being non-deceptive.
From the Commentary on the Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning: Just as compounded phenomena appear falsely and deceive ordinary beings, nirvana appears through ultimate truth but does not deceive. Therefore, it is explained that nirvana is true while other things are untrue. Thus, one must definitely accept that the division into true and untrue refers to what deceives and what does not deceive.
From the Commentary on the Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning, while nirvana is stated to be true on the conventional level, this means that nirvana, which exists as ultimate truth, is established from the perspective of the conventional – it is not intended to mean that it is true in mere conventional terms. Thus, since conventional truth is the method for entering into ultimate truth, the Madhyamika also accepts conventional designations in accordance with worldly custom without analyzing production from self or other.
When examining phenomena such as form and feeling in terms of whether they arise from self or from other, upon such analysis, in ultimate reality which is of the nature of suchness, they are neither arising nor ceasing. Beyond that, no other aspect involving arising and so forth can be found. Therefore, in conventional worldly truth, one should not analyze in terms of "from self" or "from other" and such. Rather, one should accept merely the worldly observation that "when this exists, that arises," engaging only with conventions that depend on worldly consensus. As Āryadeva states: "Just as barbarians cannot be understood in another language, similarly the world cannot be understood except through worldly conventions." And as stated in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā: "Without relying on conventional truth, the ultimate truth cannot be understood. Without understanding the ultimate truth, nirvana cannot be attained." And as stated in the Vigrahavyāvartanī: "Without accepting conventions, we cannot explain anything."
Here, "analyzed or not analyzed" refers to whether reality itself has been analyzed or not. It is important to understand at what point analysis becomes an investigation into reality itself. To explain briefly, according to the Prasangika tradition: Not being satisfied with mere conventional designations, when examining statements like "the sprout is born," searching for whether what is designated is born from self or other is considered analysis of reality itself. Therefore, one should understand that this is completely different from worldly conventional analysis that asks questions like "where did it come from and where does it go?" or "where does it exist, externally or internally?"
The Svātantrika do not establish ultimate analysis merely from that point. Rather, as explained before, they begin by investigating whether things exist by way of appearing to consciousness or whether they are established from the side of the object independent of being posited through that [appearance]. From there, they proceed to ultimate analysis. Due to this different way of identifying what is to be negated, there emerge two different points at which ultimate analysis begins.$$Without understanding this, for example, if in a certain place Devadatta has actually not arrived, but first there is the misconception that he has arrived, and then upon analysis of whether he has or has not arrived, one realizes he has not arrived - if based on such an example, one were to claim that all conventional designations prior to analysis have only false meanings while all analytical designations are not false, this would be neither the Madhyamaka nor the Pramāṇika position. This is because according to both systems, many things established by valid cognition occur within conventional, unanalyzed designations. This has been explained extensively elsewhere, so I will not elaborate further.
When examining conventional phenomena through reasoning that analyzes ultimate reality, one should understand that all worldly conventions will be undermined.
Third, if someone argues that when cutting through all grasping at true existence in phenomena, this grasping at conventional truth as truly existent - which becomes a cause for both bondage and liberation - must arise as some inherently established nature that exists through its own characteristics, then for one who makes such a statement, only mere words remain.
Why is this so? Just as when analyzing ultimate reality, as explained before, whatever logic shows that the production of form and so forth from self or other is not reasonable, similarly, even conventionally, by that same logic, production is not reasonable. Therefore, by what valid cognition can your inherent production be established? It cannot be established. Therefore, even though one may not wish to accept it, one must necessarily accept that production through inherent characteristics does not exist in either of the two truths. As stated, when examining ultimate reality, the production that is negated even conventionally by reasoning is explained in the connection as production of inherent substance, and in the summary as explained before, the qualification of "through inherent characteristics" applies only to what is being negated, not to mere production itself. This is because it has been stated many times that ultimate analysis cannot be applied to conventional objects.
If reasoning analyzing ultimate reality does not negate conventionally self-characterized production, then ultimately established production would also not be negated. This view holds that mere self-characterization becomes truly established, so whether or not one adds "conventionally" makes no difference.$$Thus, when negating the object of negation, countless qualifiers like "by self-characteristics," "by intrinsic nature," "by own essence," etc. appear in the sutras and in the works of the Father and Son (Nagarjuna and Aryadeva) and this master. When refuting such views, some Madhyamikas who made this the opponent's position are as explained before. The Clear Words (Prasannapada) also states: "This must necessarily be accepted exactly as it is, for otherwise, would not the conventional be reasonable? Therefore, this would become ultimate truth rather than conventional truth."$$When one refutes establishing conventional meanings through analysis searching for the referent rather than being satisfied with mere conventional designation, this implies that: 1) it would become ultimately existent, 2) form and other phenomena would not be conventional. This is directed at someone who does not accept forms etc. as ultimately established but posits them as conventional. Since this is not directed at Realists, it is very clear that it refers to Svatantrika Madhyamikas.
Here, some say that when the Master (Nāgārjuna) refuted arising and so forth through passages like "Not from self, not from other..." from the Noble One's presence, he was refuting the conceptually imagined arising of apprehended and apprehender as separate substances, but did not refute the true existence of dependent phenomena. However, since there is no logical reasoning to interpret it this way, this position is merely something to be debated and examined. Although some earlier scholars claim this opposing view was expressed by Master Buddhapālita and others, such an explanation does not appear in his texts.
As explained in the Commentary to the Four Hundred (Catuhśataka), when Master Dharmapāla interpreted the philosophical view of the Four Hundred as Mind-Only (Cittamātra), it was considered appropriate to apply it in that context.
If one asks how the commentators who interpret the meaning of the profound sutras as Mind-Only (Cittamatra) explain the meaning of Arya Nagarjuna's texts, although it is not clearly stated in the texts of great masters like Acharya Vasubandhu and others that "this is how Nagarjuna's texts should be interpreted," it appears that in works like the Vyākhyāyukti, they explain the Prajñāpāramitā sutras as interpretable teachings (drang don) based on the Saṃdhinirmocana Sutra. It seems they explain it similarly because it is impossible to refute Arya Nagarjuna's texts. If explained literally, they would not explain the Prajñāpāramitā sutras non-literally, and if the literal meaning is explained as interpretable teaching, its meaning must be explained as Mind-Only.
However, when it is explained that all phenomena are not ultimately established and are not established by their own characteristics, these statements can be logically proven exactly as they are stated. Since there is no contradiction in taking these statements literally, and considering that they cannot be interpreted as requiring interpretation, it is stated that "these are solely matters for investigation and analysis." The text demonstrates countless refutations of positions contrary to the literal meaning and proofs supporting the direct interpretation. Since this establishes that the meaning of the text cannot be interpreted differently, only a brief explanation is given here.
Secondly, if inherently existent production does not exist in either of the two truths, then forms and so forth would not exist. In that case, the nature of forms and so forth would not be observed by eye consciousness and other consciousnesses in the world. If that were not the case, then rabbit horns and such would also appear to eye consciousness and other consciousnesses, since the reasoning would be exactly the same.$$In response to this, it is explained: Empty phenomena, which are false, like reflections and so forth (including echoes), are dependent on and arise in reliance upon collections of causes and conditions like mirrors, faces, caves, and sound production - this is well-known in the world, not unknown. Just as is well-known in the world, from empty (false) things like reflections and so forth, eye consciousness and other consciousnesses bearing the aspects of those reflections and so forth arise.
Just as false cognition arises from false reflections, similarly, although all phenomena are empty of inherent existence, from causes that are empty of inherent existence, effects that are empty of inherent existence manifestly arise. Here, it is taught that from reflections arises the eye consciousness that apprehends them. Since reflections are things that are distinct in nature from consciousness, they are external objects, and because they are the observed conditions for eye consciousness, they are considered to be part of the visual sphere. This should be understood similarly for the appearance of double moons, floating hairs, magical illusions, and echoes. Thus, the appearances to mistaken sense consciousness, such as reflections, double moons, and floating hairs, are similar to those that appear to the five sense consciousnesses that are free from temporary sensory impairment as being inherently existent.
Although appearances such as faces are impossible [to exist inherently], they appear as such - similar to how [phenomena] appear to be established by their own characteristics while being impossible to be so established.
Reflections and echoes are similar to forms and sounds. Therefore, just as the five sense objects like forms are not established as external objects by their own nature, yet their appearances are posited as external, similarly, although reflections and such are not posited externally as being actual faces and so forth, reflections and such are posited as external - thus these two are equivalent in terms of what is and is not posited as external.
It is entirely incorrect to consider the mere understanding that reflections are empty of their own nature (like a mirror image) as a coarse form of rational cognition, since even worldly elders who have never directed their minds toward any scriptural or logical teachings about emptiness can understand this through ordinary conventional understanding.
If that is so, although the false reflection is well-known to be established, it would not establish the falsity as posited by the Madhyamikas. So how can the former serve as an example for the latter? In this context, when reflections and such are presented as examples, they are being used as examples of what is already established by worldly convention, rather than presenting examples of what has already been established as false by the Madhyamikas.
Furthermore, just as in the case of a reflection appearing like a face, one cannot completely distinguish which aspects appear as the face and which do not appear as the face. Although empty of existing exactly as it appears from all aspects of the face's appearance, it is not contradictory that it arises in dependence on its causes. Similarly, when blue appears to be established by its own characteristics, there is no distinction between aspects that appear and do not appear to be inherently established from blue's side. Although empty of existing exactly as it appears from all aspects, this proves there is no contradiction with it being produced by its causes and producing its effects. Just as we can establish that while a facial reflection does not exist exactly as it appears from all aspects, it doesn't mean the reflection is non-existent. Similarly, with blue, although it does not exist as an object exactly as it appears to be established by its own characteristics from all aspects, we can definitely establish that blue exists.
Through precise analysis, distinguishing between what is negated and what is not negated in terms of form and so forth through the example of reflections is indispensable for realizing the Madhyamaka view, so one should not be easily satisfied. Therefore, the Commentary also states that while establishing the causeless and resultless nature of reflections, what wise person who understands would determine that forms, feelings, and so forth, which are inseparable from causes and effects, have inherent existence merely because they are observed to exist? Therefore, although they are observed to exist, they do not arise inherently. This clearly distinguishes between mere existence and inherent existence, and between arising and inherent arising, as it first teaches arising and then teaches the absence of inherent arising.$$If these distinctions are not made, then as long as things exist, they would have to exist by their own essence, and if they lack their own essence, they would become utterly non-existent, not going beyond the two extremes of exaggeration and deprecation. As stated in the Commentary to the Four Hundred: "According to those who assert the existence of things, as long as that thing exists, it must also have its own essence. When it lacks its own essence, then it would be completely non-existent in all aspects, like a donkey's horns. Thus, not going beyond dualistic assertions, all their claims become difficult to establish."$$Therefore, freedom from all extremes of existence through the lack of inherent existence, and freedom from all extremes of non-existence through the ability to establish causality despite the absence of inherent nature, appears to be the unique feature of Masters Buddhapālita and Candrakīrti's interpretation of the Noble One's intent. Thus, it is extremely important to distinguish between the two types of existence and the two types of non-existence.
Establishing through the example of reflections: From "The Meeting of Father and Son":$"Just as reflections appear$In a perfectly clean mirror$Though lacking inherent existence,$Know all phenomena to be likewise."$Thus it is taught. Also understand that the way of connecting examples and meanings for other examples of falsity follows the same pattern as before.
Fifth, there are two [points]: the quality of easily abandoning eternalist and nihilist views, and the quality of highly reasonable connection between karma and its results.$$First: Because all phenomena are empty of inherent existence, like reflections, therefore, since there is no inherent establishment in either or both of the two truths - ultimate and conventional - forms and so forth are neither inherently established as permanent, nor are they annihilated. $$Annihilation refers to cases like when a seed is destroyed when the sprout appears, and as stated in Mūlamadhyamakakārikā: "That which existed before but does not exist now would lead to the consequence of annihilation." If one accepts that things are inherently established and then holds that previously existent things later become non-existent or cease (impermanence), this becomes a nihilistic view. This is because if one accepts things as inherently existent, whether one considers them permanent or impermanent, it is taught that one falls into the extreme views of eternalism or nihilism.
Here, in the commentary on the Mūlamadhyamakakārika, it states: "Just as the Buddha emanates an emanation, and that emanation in turn emanates another, similarly, the agent, action, and what is done by them are like those emanations." This teaches that from that which lacks inherent existence, things that lack inherent existence arise. This statement shows that there is no nihilistic view since all actions and activities are established within that which lacks inherent existence.
If one does not negate inherent existence at the conventional level, one cannot realize the subtlest selflessness. Since it is then difficult to prevent the arising of extremely subtle views of eternalism and nihilism in one's mindstream, the complete abandonment of views of eternalism and nihilism is a quality that comes from negating that object of negation at the conventional level. When existence at the conventional level is negated, not only does one avoid falling into views of eternalism and nihilism with respect to ultimate truth, but since one is not tainted by views of eternalism and nihilism even with respect to conventional truth, there is the quality of easily abandoning views of eternalism and nihilism.
Second, there are three parts: showing that those who do not accept inherent existence need not accept alaya-vijnana and so forth; demonstrating examples of how results arise from ceased karma; and dispelling objections to this explanation. The first has three parts: explaining the connecting text, explaining the meaning of the root text, and explaining the extended meaning.$$First, not only does the absence of inherent nature in both truths thoroughly eliminate the extreme views of eternalism and nihilism, but even when karmic actions have long ceased, their connection with results is logically tenable without positing concepts like alaya-vijnana (storehouse consciousness), mental continuum, non-dissipation, attainment, and so forth.$$This shows that in the position where there is no inherent existence even conventionally, not only is there the benefit of thoroughly eliminating the extreme views of eternalism and nihilism, but there is also the benefit that the relationship between karma and its results is highly tenable even without accepting alaya-vijnana and so forth.
Although in the commentarial tradition of the Noble Ones there is not even a particle that is established by its own characteristics, this unique system of commentary that allows for the establishment of all actions and activities serves as a basis for many unique interpretations of pure philosophical tenets not shared with other commentators. What are these? To state the main ones:$$1. The alaya-consciousness as distinct from the six consciousnesses$2. A unique way of refuting self-awareness$3. Not accepting that the ultimate view can be generated in others' minds through autonomous syllogisms$4. The necessity of accepting external objects just as consciousness is accepted$5. The understanding that Hearers and Solitary Realizers can realize the lack of inherent existence$6. Considering the grasping at the selfhood of phenomena as an affliction$7. That cessation is a functional thing$8. Based on this reasoning, a unique way of establishing the three times$$The first of these is taught in this context, while how the rejection of self-awareness relates to the rejection of inherent existence will be explained later.
While the extensive explanation of how this relates to not accepting the self-continuum has been explained elsewhere, a brief explanation will also be given here.
Regarding the acceptance of external objects, this will be explained later. As for how the fifth also comes down to this: Buddhapalita, based on the Śrāvaka scriptures which state "all phenomena are selfless," explained that the self that is being negated refers to inherent existence, and this is also accepted here. This is the complete meaning of selflessness. Therefore, the complete characteristic of the selflessness of persons must also refer to the absence of inherent existence of persons. Similarly, to properly understand this, one must also understand the true nature of the selflessness of phenomena. This being the case, since the grasping at the self of phenomena must be considered as definitely being an affliction, there are many distinctions regarding: the identification of afflictions as gross and subtle; the two positions on whether or not liberation can be achieved merely through the path of the sixteen aspects such as impermanence; and the different points at which cognitive obscurations are abandoned, and so forth.
Now, both Madhyamika schools must accept the possibility of someone who initially entered the Mahayana path with a good understanding of the view of suchness, yet later falls into the Hinayana path. If this is the case, one must also accept that such a person can directly realize selflessness of phenomena through meditation and continue to familiarize themselves with what they have already seen. In that case, one must accept that through this path, the conceptual grasping at the self of phenomena is eliminated at the path of seeing, and the innate grasping at that self is eliminated from the path of meditation. Therefore, one might wonder if the Madhyamika system, which asserts that things exist by their own characteristics, also accepts two types of grasping at the self of phenomena - afflicted and non-afflicted. Although this is not clearly explained, these Svatantrika Madhyamikas must maintain that while Shravakas and Pratyekabuddhas practicing such a path may temporarily eliminate manifest grasping at the self of phenomena, without the support of accumulating limitless collections of merit, they cannot eliminate the seeds of either type of grasping at the self of phenomena. Therefore, they must assert that while Shravakas and Pratyekabuddhas can temporarily eliminate manifest cognitive obscurations, it is impossible for them to eliminate their seeds.
According to this master's view, since the grasping at the true existence of phenomena is an affliction, one does not need the support of accumulating endless collections of merit to eliminate its seeds. However, he maintains that without such support, one cannot purify the cognitive obscurations of habitual tendencies of dualistic appearances. If one understands these previously explained points, it appears to make an extremely great difference, hence this explanation.
Second, regarding the position that holds phenomena do not exist inherently: How can the relationship between karma and its effects be valid without accepting the alaya consciousness and so forth? When virtuous and non-virtuous karma, even after being separated by a long period of time from their effects, produce results such as happiness and suffering - this is accepted by all our schools, both higher and lower. If that karma were to remain unchanged until it produces its result, it would become permanent. Since something permanent cannot perform a function, the relationship between karma and its resulting effects would not be logically tenable.
When the action ceases in the second moment after it is performed, from that point until it directly produces its result, that action no longer exists. Since both the action and its cessation are non-existent, how can the result arise from the action? In response to this challenge: When the previous action is about to cease in the second moment after the action is performed, some posit the alaya-vijnana (store consciousness) to establish the potency of karma, while others assert the existence of an non-associated compositional factor called 'non-destruction' (avipranāśa), which is different from both the action and its documentation, similar to a debt contract.
Some assert that what is called "the attainment of the two karmas" is a non-associated compositional factor that exists as something separate from those two.
Some assert that karma imprints latent dispositions on the continuum of consciousness. Therefore, they maintain there is no contradiction in karma producing results long after the karma has ceased, because karma leaves imprints on the alaya consciousness, and these imprints are the fruits of karma. Through the continuation of similar types [of imprints], results are ultimately produced, so they maintain that the original karmic results arise through continuation.$$This should be understood similarly for the other three [positions]. The first position is held by some Cittamatra (Mind-Only) scholars. The second is held by the Vaibhashikas, as explained by Avalokitavrata - specifically a group different from the Kashmiri Vaibhashikas. The third is also held by another subset of Vaibhashikas. While the fourth position is not explicitly stated, when compared with the ninth chapter of the Abhidharmakosa commentary, it appears to be the position held by both the Sautrantikas and Kashmiri Vaibhashikas.
Although the Kashmiris accept attainment, they do not accept that attainment is produced by both the attained phenomenon and the two [causes], whereas here it is accepted in that way - this is the meaning of "according to whom."
According to the Prasangika Madhyamaka view, since karma does not arise inherently by its own nature, and because results can arise from karma that has not inherently ceased, there is no contradiction in effects arising from karma even without accepting concepts like alaya (ground consciousness). Therefore, understand that even when two karmas performed in some beings' mindstreams have ceased and much time - many eons - has passed, genuine results arise from those karmas without fail, with effects properly corresponding to their causes. Thus, in this view, the relationship between karma and its effects is extremely well-established and logical. Regarding the meaning of these points, all four respondents to the earlier objection accept that karma's arising and cessation are established by their own characteristics, and they maintain that the cessation of karma after it is performed is inherently established.
It would be incorrect for this master to respond that there is no fault [in this position] because they accept the alaya-consciousness and so forth, even though [they accept] such cessation. This is because [the text] refutes [this view] by stating that there is neither arising nor cessation of karma in terms of inherent existence.
To show that this way of responding is in accordance with Ārya Nāgārjuna's view, he quotes from the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā:$$"Because karma has no arising,$As it lacks inherent existence,$Because it is unborn,$Therefore it cannot be wasted."$$This means: Because karma lacks inherent existence, it does not arise by its own nature. Therefore, since karma cannot inherently cease, it is not logical to conceive that karma, after being performed and having ceased, exists inherently and cannot be wasted.
Although this reasoning is stated to refute the notion of non-dissipation, it applies equally to refuting the other three [misunderstandings], because the underlying logic is exactly the same in all cases.
From the sutra: "Though it is said that a human's lifespan is one hundred years, and one lives that long, years cannot be accumulated in a heap. The accomplishment is likewise similar to that. What is spoken of as 'without cessation' and what is spoken of as 'karma exhausted' - in terms of emptiness, there is no cessation; in terms of conventional expression, cessation is taught."$$This is cited as scriptural authority for [the teaching that] there is no inherently existent exhaustion or cessation, and that these two are established merely by the power of conventional designation.
From Nagtsho's translation: "Just as years piled into heaps are non-existent, likewise one should view these aggregates as truly non-existent." This explains the qualification of what is to be negated, namely that they do not cease by their own nature.
For the third point, there are two parts: How the absence of inherent cessation serves as a reason for not accepting the alaya (ground consciousness), and how despite not accepting the alaya, there is still a basis for habitual tendencies.$$For the first part: Although there is no inherently existent cessation, even in our own system it is stated "karma has ceased in some cases" and "having ceased, there is no inherent nature." As shown in the statement "this is merely conventional," after karma is performed, that karma must be accepted as having ceased. At that time, while the cessation is not a real entity and we do not accept the alaya consciousness as a basis for the connection between karma and its results, one might object: "How can results arise from karma that has long since ceased? The previous answers are insufficient."$$There is no fault in this because, as stated in "Because that does not inherently cease, therefore..." - this very reasoning establishes that results can arise later from the cessation of ceased karma. Thus, no separate answer was needed.
Furthermore, for all positions that assert things exist inherently, cessation cannot be a real thing. But for the Madhyamaka position that asserts things do not exist inherently, cessation is established as a real thing - this is the key point. According to the first system, when something like a sprout ceases, all the constituent parts of the sprout disappear, and no other thing like a pot is obtained. Therefore, they assert that cessation is absolutely not a real thing, thinking that neither individual real things like blue color etc. that are sense objects, nor collections of constituent parts like a pot can serve as instances of that cessation, so it is not a real thing. According to the latter system, for example, just as neither the five aggregates of Devadatta individually or collectively, nor something different from both of these can be posited as the instance of Devadatta, and Devadatta cannot serve as an instance of these three, yet Devadatta imputed in dependence on his aggregates is not contradictory to being a real thing - similarly, although cessation has no instances either in the thing that ceases or in similar things, because it arises in dependence on the thing that ceases, it is a real thing.
To establish this, there are two approaches - scriptural and logical - as explained in Prasannapadā. The first, from the Daśabhūmika Sūtra, states: "Due to the condition of birth, there is aging and death." Death refers to the destruction of the deceased being. It is taught that this is produced by the condition of birth. Furthermore, from the same text: "Death also has two functions: it destroys the conditioned phenomena and produces the uninterrupted cause of ignorance." Thus it teaches that death performs two functions: death is produced by causes, and death produces ignorance. Therefore, destruction has causes that produce it, and destruction can produce effects. Although this refers to the destruction in continuity, it applies equally to the destruction of the first moment in the second time period. It also demonstrates the cause of the destruction of the first moment in the second time period. Thus, for beings' birth and death, not remaining for a second moment, and not staying for a second moment - these are all equivalent in terms of whether they are established as real entities and whether they are produced by causes.
With this in mind, the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā states: "Both existence and non-existence are conditioned phenomena." And likewise, in the Yuktiṣaṣṭikā it states: "Cessation, which comes from the exhaustion of causes, is observed as exhaustion." This means that both things like sprouts and their absence (non-existence) are conditioned phenomena, and just as the exhaustion of a cause like oil leads to the exhaustion of its result like a lamp flame. This should definitely be accepted as the noble one's (Nāgārjuna's) intended meaning.
The cessation of the first moment in the second time must be understood by directly eliminating what is to be negated. While it is a negation, it is not a non-affirming negation but rather an affirming negation, because it does not merely eliminate what is to be destroyed but implies the existence of something that remains after the elimination. The remaining proofs should be understood in detail from the commentary on Mūlamadhyamakakārikā. This appears to be one of the subtle yet profoundly significant logical arguments in this system.
Secondly, even if one does not accept the alaya-consciousness (ground consciousness), one must accept that karmic imprints of virtuous and non-virtuous actions are deposited, and that results arise from the ripening of these imprints. As stated in the Madhyamakavatara Commentary: "In beginningless samsara, the karmic imprints of phenomena that have been deposited and fully ripened manifest in [new] phenomena." Many other similar statements also appear [in authoritative texts].
Furthermore, since there must be a basis for the imprints to be placed, what is that basis? According to those who accept the alaya-vijnana (foundation consciousness), just as they assert that the alaya-vijnana - which serves as the basis for the afflicted mind's conception of "I" - is the repository of imprints, similarly this system also maintains that the object of the innate mind that merely thinks "I" is itself the basis for establishing imprints.
If one asks how it is that the Commentary on Entering (Madhyamaka) explains the mind-stream as the basis for habitual tendencies: Since the mere "I" is imputed in dependence upon mind and consciousness and is a continuum, it is also called "mind-stream." Just as the similar types of mind itself are called its continuum, that too becomes the basis for imprinting occasional habitual tendencies.
Regarding the nature of habitual tendencies of ignorance, as stated in the Madhyamakavatara Commentary: "That which stains, obscures, and subsequently influences the mental continuum is called habitual tendency (bagchags). The terms 'culmination of afflictions,' 'habituation,' 'root,' and 'habitual tendency' are synonymous. Even though afflictions may be abandoned through the uncontaminated path, these tendencies cannot be eliminated by Shravakas and Pratyekabuddhas. It is like how subtle qualities remain detectable in pots and cloth even after removing oil and flowers, due to previous contact with them."
As for other latent dispositions such as virtuous and non-virtuous predispositions, they should be appropriately applied as having two bases. Now, during the uninterrupted path of the path of seeing, although there are no objects of abandonment to be abandoned through seeing, there must be dormant afflictions to be abandoned through meditation. At that time, since mental consciousness is uncontaminated and unspoiled by the latent dispositions of dualistic delusion, it's not reasonable for those dormant afflictions to exist as its nature. Since sense consciousnesses are not their basis, and form is not reasonable as their basis, and the alaya (foundation consciousness) is not accepted, it would seem there is no basis for them.$$However, there is no fault because at that time, the mere 'I' serves as the basis for the dormant afflictions to be abandoned through meditation. This should be understood similarly for other objects of abandonment and their antidotes. When one understands this system's unique way of establishing the person, then for noble beings born in the infinite space realm, infinite consciousness realm, and nothingness realm, when their uncontaminated supramundane minds become manifest, since there are no other worldly minds present, their states of existence would cease.
When a noble one born in the Peak of Existence manifests an uncontaminated mind belonging to the sphere of nothingness, the beings included in both the Peak of Existence and the sphere of nothingness will cease, because that uncontaminated mind's state is not suitable for either those two realms of existence or the state of nirvana. The reasoning presented here appears not to contradict, since both contaminated and uncontaminated minds need not be established as the defining characteristics of those realms of existence - it is sufficient just to establish the realms themselves. According to the previous position, this refers to the nature of existence for those who have not entered the path and learners as being unobstructed and neutral. How could someone like myself possibly explain these responses to the great traditions through my own power? However, this explanation is based on the tradition of the great charioteers who knew how to perfectly establish the exact intention of Protector Nagarjuna. Based on these, it appears that the remaining logical arguments establishing alaya-vijnana (store consciousness) also do not contradict this system. This should be investigated by those of great, precise and sharp intelligence.
Second, explaining through an example the meaning of how results arise from ceased karma as explained before: Just as when a foolish person sees an attractive woman in a dream, and even after waking up when that object has ceased and is no longer present, strong attachment arises based on that ceased object; similarly, even from ceased karma which has no inherent existence, karmic results can arise. This demonstrates how results can arise from ceased karma.
As evidence for this, from the Siddha Transition Sutra: "Great King, it is like this: suppose a man dreams while sleeping that he is intimate with a beautiful woman of the region. After waking up from sleep, he remembers that beautiful woman of the region. What do you think about this, Great King? Would that man who dreamed of being intimate with the beautiful woman of the region and who, after waking up, remembers that beautiful woman - would such a man be considered wise?" [The king] replied, "No, Blessed One, he would not. Why is that? Blessed One, since the beautiful woman in the dream does not exist and cannot be found, how could there be any real intimacy with her? Indeed, such a man would become one with an unfortunate and exhausted destiny." This citation serves as an example.
Similarly, O Great King, when ordinary childish beings who lack learning see forms with their eyes, they become attached to forms that bring pleasure to the mind. Having become attached, they generate desire. After becoming desirous, they engage in physical, verbal, and mental actions that arise from attachment, hatred, and delusion.
After that karma is manifestly conditioned, it ceases. When ceased, it does not abide depending on the eastern direction, up to "nor in any of the intermediate directions." As stated, being without hearing means not realizing the truth from hearing teachings that reveal ultimate reality.
Clinging/attachment is grasping at truth/reality.
Among the three types of karma arising from attachment, both virtuous and non-virtuous karma exist; karma arising from anger is non-virtuous; and from ignorance too, both types of karma can be accumulated.
The immediate cessation of actions is conventional, while the remainder negates inherently established cessation. Then, when the time and moment of death draws near, when the karma that sustained this life is exhausted, at the time of the cessation of the final consciousness, it is like this: Just as a person who awakens from sleep might immediately turn their mind toward the image of a beautiful woman from the human realm, similarly, when the similar karma (meaning the aggregates of the same type) that sustained this life is exhausted, and when this life's final consciousness ceases, like how a person with attachment recalls a beautiful woman from their dream immediately upon waking, at the time of death, the mind turns toward the karma that will ripen in the next life as its potential awakens, rather than through remembering.
Thus, when the final consciousness ceases and the first consciousness belonging to rebirth arises, it may arise among the gods, or... up to... it may arise among the hungry ghosts. As stated, the final cessation refers to [the consciousness] of this life.
Regarding the first consciousness that belongs to birth, it is taught "among the devas" and so forth. The intermediate state (bardo) is not one of the six realms, so this refers to birth consciousness. Although there exists an intermediate state between death and birth, it appears that in many teachings it is not mentioned, as the main focus is on establishing the relationship between karma and its results in terms of birth and death. Then, immediately after that first consciousness ceases, there arises a continuum of mind similar in nature to that which will experience the ripening of karma.
Great King, there is no phenomenon that transfers from this world to the next world, yet there is death, transmigration, and rebirth. Great King, what we call death is the cessation of the final consciousness, and what we call birth is the arising of the first consciousness.
Great King, when the final consciousness ceases, it does not go anywhere.
When consciousness arises as part of birth, it does not come from anywhere. Why is this so? Because it is empty of inherent nature.
Great King, the final consciousness is empty of final consciousness. Death and transmigration are empty of death and transmigration.
Karma is empty of karma.
The first consciousness is empty of the first consciousness.
It is taught that birth is empty of birth, yet karma does not go to waste. This means that before taking rebirth and forming a connection, one experiences the pleasant or unpleasant results of previous karma. The continuum of consciousness experiencing those results arises from the first moment of birth consciousness. While death, transition, and birth exist conventionally, they do not exist ultimately. The reason for this is that they are devoid of inherent nature. This qualification of what is being negated should be applied as taught - that the final consciousness and so forth are empty of their own nature. When taught this way, lest one mistakenly grasp that karma and its effects do not exist, it is taught that karma does not go to waste.
Third, there are two parts: refuting the argument of endless ripening of karma, and refuting the argument that contradicts the scriptures teaching the existence of alaya (ground consciousness).$$First: If one accepts that since karma is not inherently produced, it has no inherent cessation and therefore produces results, then similarly, from karma that has already ripened, there would be further ripening, leading to the fault of infinite regression.$$Just as, for example, while objects are equally non-existent, those with eye disease see appearances of non-existent hair-like strands and such, but do not see other object-appearances like donkey horns or children of barren women, similarly, although karma is equally lacking inherent existence, understand that unripened karma ripens but ripened karma does not ripen again.
This example not only shows that the results of actions definitely come to fruition, but also explains that virtuous and non-virtuous actions definitely produce their respective pleasant and unpleasant results. Just as someone with impaired vision definitely sees floating hairs and such while definitely not seeing non-existent things like donkey horns, pleasant karmic ripening cannot arise from non-virtuous actions, and unpleasant karmic ripening cannot come from virtuous actions. The unpleasant ripening results come from dark (negative) actions.
The ripening of virtue, which is pleasant/agreeable, is seen to arise from virtuous actions.
Those with minds free from virtuous and non-virtuous karma, who realize the absence of inherent existence, will be liberated from samsara. Therefore, when ordinary beings meticulously analyze through logical reasoning the causes and conditions of how specific karmic actions lead to specific results, as taught by the Buddha, they might think that denying karma and its effects will destroy conventional reality. Thus, the Buddha taught that "the ripening of karmic results is inconceivable" and discouraged analytical investigation based on karma and its effects.
In this text, fearing that certainty in karma and its results might be lost through many approaches, methods were employed through various ways to generate certainty in karma and its results. Understanding this, and with the view of emptiness also supporting and stabilizing this certainty, strive now to ensure that your journey to this precious island (or realm) does not go to waste.
Second, there are three parts: The actual meaning of words that dispel scriptural contradictions; the manner of explaining or not explaining the alaya-vijnana as distinct from mental consciousness; and showing examples of teachings given with interpretive intent.$$First, if karma and its results can be established even without alaya-vijnana, then what about the teachings in the Lankavatara Sutra and others like the Samdhinirmocana Sutra and the Mahayana Abhidharma Sutra, which describe the alaya-vijnana as the foundation containing the seeds and special potentials of all phenomenal dharmas, teaching that it is the cause for the arising of all inner and outer phenomena, just as waves arise from the ocean? Is there no way to establish its system at all?$$This is not the case. By teaching the existence of alaya-vijnana to those to be trained, it was taught as existent for their sake. This shows that alaya-vijnana is accepted from the perspective of disciples due to necessity. When explaining our own system's interpretive meaning, one should understand that the basis for interpretation, the intended meaning behind these teachings, refers only to emptiness - the lack of inherent existence - through the term alaya-vijnana.
As for what is taught as the all-ground (ālaya), it is because that nature pervades/follows all phenomena.
Not only does it teach the existence of the ground consciousness (ālayavijñāna) due to necessity, but it also teaches that the person exists substantially. This is because it guides those who need to be trained by teaching them that it exists. As it is said: "Monks, the five aggregates are the burden. The bearer of the burden is the person." This is like when those who hold that persons exist as independent substances asked questions, rather than teaching that such persons do not exist, it was taught that there exists a person who bears the burden. Although not explicitly stated in the words, the meaning implies substantial existence.
For some disciples, he taught merely the aggregates without a substantially existing person, saying: "That which is called mind, or consciousness, or awareness, when thoroughly imbued with faith, moral discipline, and so forth for a long time, and when progressing upward, will proceed to higher realms in future lives."
Furthermore, for those who hold as true the methods of progressing to higher realms and liberation, when considering what should be accepted, without refuting the object of their true grasping, when teaching that these are merely aggregates, it implicitly teaches the aggregates as truly existent. All these teachings were spoken with an intentional purpose.
If one asks "For which disciples was this taught with [Buddha's] intention?", the answer should be stated: [It was taught for those who believe that] the foundation consciousness (ālayavijñāna) exists and that the person exists as a substantial entity.
This teaching that states "these aggregates alone exist as true reality" was taught with consideration for those disciples who, as explained earlier, are temporarily unable to understand or realize such profound meaning.
Those disciples who have long been accustomed to non-Buddhist philosophical views are unable to enter into the profound nature of reality. As stated in the Precious Garland (Ratnavali): "The self does not exist and will not exist. The possessions of the self do not exist and will not exist. The childish ones become frightened by this." In this way, when first taught the nature of reality, they become frightened and view the Buddha's teachings as if they were a precipice. Turning their backs on the teachings and not entering into them, they will not accomplish great purpose.$$For these individuals, rather than initially teaching the ultimate profound points, teaching about the alaya-consciousness, the truth of aggregates and so forth will help eliminate non-Buddhist systems based on those teachings. This will lead them toward great purpose, and later, those who properly understand the meaning of the scriptures will themselves abandon grasping at the existence of alaya and so forth. Therefore, teaching in this way brings only benefits and not faults.
With this gradual approach in mind, it is said in the Śatakaśāstra (Hundred Verses):$"Whatever brings joy to whomever,$That should be practiced first by them.$One whose mind has deteriorated$Can never be a vessel for the holy Dharma."
Regarding the need to teach the alaya (ground consciousness) as being inherently different from the six consciousnesses: since external objects need to be refuted, it is only suitable as a basis for the mere reality (suchness) that is empty of subject and object as separate substances.
Although one may not accept the ālaya-vijñāna (foundation consciousness) as previously explained, since one cannot establish the connection between karma and its results, it is taught that one will not understand this most profound meaning.
Secondly, when explaining the enumeration of consciousness in many texts like the Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines and others, there are many sutras that teach only the six collections of consciousness and do not teach more than that. Thus, just as there are two approaches in the sutras - those that establish the alaya-consciousness and those that do not - Noble Maitreya also, when commenting on their meaning, explains the establishment of alaya-consciousness and the view of no external objects in the Madhyantavibhaga, Mahayanasutralamkara, and Dharmatavibhanga, while in the Abhisamayalamkara and Uttaratantra, he explains the approach that does not establish alaya-consciousness and does not refute external objects.
Even the great master Asanga did not explain the intent of the Uttaratantra (Gyü Lama) according to the Mind-Only (Cittamatra) system, but rather explained it according to the Middle Way (Madhyamaka) system. In the Mahāyānasaṃgraha, regarding the scriptural citation from Abhidharma used to prove the existence of the alaya-consciousness, the commentary on the Uttaratantra states: "Although sentient beings possess the established Buddha-nature (Tathāgatagarbha) which is their essence, those sentient beings do not realize it."
As it is said: "The primordial, beginningless realm is the basis of all phenomena. Because it exists, all beings can attain nirvana." This is cited as proof that sentient beings possess the natural state (dharmatā). Since this master explains the basis of consciousness (ālayavijñāna) as being emptiness, he maintains that the ālayavijñāna, which is distinct from the six consciousnesses, was taught for the sake of certain disciples due to necessity.
In the Commentary on Bodhicitta, it states:$"Just as iron swiftly turns$When brought near a magnet,$Though it has no mind,$It appears as if conscious.$Similarly, the alaya-consciousness,$Though not truly real, appears as real,$When it moves to and fro,$Then it holds onto existence.$Just as in the ocean, wood$Though mindless, moves about,$Similarly, the alaya-consciousness$Moves in dependence on the body."$$When asked how to interpret this statement about alaya-consciousness holding onto existence, this teaching of mind-only that refutes external objects as separate from mind, without refuting the inherent existence of mind itself, was taught to prevent beginners from becoming frightened when taught about emptiness. It is not the definitive truth. When refuting the Yogacara position that accepts a purified mind that is inherently established and self-cognizing, one might object that if mind is not truly existent, the movement of beings coming from previous lives to this one and going from this life to future ones would be impossible. In response to this implicit objection, it shows that just as iron and wood can move without having consciousness, similarly the alaya-consciousness, though not truly existent, appears to exist and move to and fro. Therefore, this does not accept the alaya-consciousness as inherently established by its own characteristics as explained in other texts.
Even if one does not accept that the alaya (ground consciousness) exists by its own characteristics, if one thinks "I accept an illusory-like alaya that is separate in essence from the six consciousnesses and contains all seeds of samsaric and pure phenomena," then if such an alaya is accepted, one must accept that appearances of form, sound, etc. merely arise from the ripening of alaya's latent imprints, and that external objects do not exist. However, as stated in that text: "Consciousness apprehends objects of knowledge; without objects of knowledge, there is no consciousness. In that case, why not accept there is neither that which is known nor knower?" This teaches that since internal consciousness and external objects of knowledge are equivalent in terms of existence/non-existence, if one does not exist, the other cannot exist either. This accords with how this text explains that the two - objects and consciousness - are equally non-existent ultimately and equally existent conventionally. Therefore, it is inappropriate to distinguish between their existence/non-existence on either of the two truths. Thus, it is not the master's position that consciousness exists without external objects. Therefore, since he does not accept an alaya consciousness separate in essence from mental consciousness, when "alaya" is mentioned, it generally refers to mind as mere clarity and awareness being posited as alaya, and specifically refers to mental consciousness. This is because: it responds to the refutation of inherently existent mind in general by showing how a non-truly existent mind can still function; because it is mental consciousness that takes rebirth in existence; and because mental consciousness is the basis for all afflicted and pure phenomena.
In the Madhyamakahdaya (Heart of the Middle Way), the literal interpretation of alaya (ground consciousness) is refuted, and Acharya Jnanagarbha, who accepts external objects, also does not accept alaya.
Even among the Cittamātra (Mind-Only) philosophers who refute external objects, there are two positions: those who accept and those who reject the existence of ālaya-vijñāna (foundation consciousness). Master Kamalaśīla, who also rejects external objects, quotes from the Abhidharmakośa which states: "It is the mental consciousness alone that has the power to connect between rebirths. As it is said: 'Interruption, connection, freedom from desire, deterioration, death, and rebirth are attributed to mental consciousness alone.'" By citing this, it is clear that the great master Śāntarakṣita also does not accept ālaya-vijñāna. Abhayākaragupta holds a similar position.
In other Mahayana scriptures, what is referred to as the alaya-vijnana (foundation consciousness) appears to be not clearly identified beyond mere name recognition. When examining its actual nature, it appears they only accept it as not being essentially different from the six consciousnesses, and this system seems to align with the position that accepts external objects, thus applying this name to the mental consciousness. Although these points need to be established in detail, I have not written more due to concerns about length.
Third, not only was the alaya-vijnana (foundation consciousness) and so forth initially taught for the sake of guiding disciples, but also, just as the Buddha Bhagavan taught about "I" and "mine" even though all conceptual thoughts of "I" and "mine" are abandoned through freedom from the view of the transitory collection along with its latent tendencies, similarly, although phenomena lack inherent existence, teaching that they inherently exist is a provisional meaning. This is a skillful means for worldly beings to gradually understand the ultimate truth.
In brief, just as when [the Buddha] speaks of "I" and "mine," although there appears to be a conception of that [self] and what belongs to it, the definitive meaning is that there is no such conception. Similarly, although teachings appear to show that phenomena are inherently established according to Buddha's intent, the definitive meaning is that phenomena do not exist in that way.
Regarding how conventional designations accord with worldly understanding, as stated in verses aligned with the Eastern Mountain School:$$If the world's guides did not$Conform to worldly ways,$Neither Buddha-nature nor$Buddhahood could be known by anyone.$$Teaching the aggregates, elements,$And sense bases as one nature,$While explaining the three realms—$This accords with worldly ways.$$Using names to explain to beings$The nameless dharmas that are$Beyond conceptual thought—$This accords with worldly ways.$$While showing non-existence$And dwelling in Buddha-nature,$Nothing truly exists here—$This accords with worldly ways.$$Not seeing meaning or meaninglessness,$Yet teaching cessation and$Ultimate truth as supreme—$This accords with worldly ways.$$Though there's no destruction or arising,$And all is equal in dharmadhatu,$Teaching about the aeon of fire—$This accords with worldly ways.$$Though beings' nature cannot be found$In any of the three times,$Still teaching the realm of beings—$This accords with worldly ways.$$This is as extensively explained in the text.
Among these, the final verse teaches the selflessness of persons by showing that sentient beings lack inherent existence, while the remaining verses teach the selflessness of phenomena by showing that both existent and non-existent phenomena lack inherent nature. According to the Tarkajvala, since the Purvashaila school gradually split off from the Mahasanghika, it appears there exists a very clear teaching of the lack of inherent nature of phenomena within the Shravakayana scriptures.
Second, regarding the specific refutation of the Cittamatra (Mind-Only) system, there are three parts: refuting the inherent existence of consciousness without external objects; refuting the valid cognition that proves the inherent existence of dependent nature; and showing that the word 'only' in 'mind-only' does not negate external objects. For the first part, there are two sections: stating others' positions and refuting those positions. First, the Vijñānavādins (Proponents of Consciousness), who cannot accept the Madhyamaka system as previously explained and consider it not to be the Buddha's intent, establish their own position through their conceptual fabrications. To clarify their position as explained in their own texts, the opponent's position is stated thus: The Bodhisattva dwelling on the sixth ground, abiding in and meditating on the supreme Prajñāpāramitā (Perfection of Wisdom), through reasoning realizes, sees, and comprehends the ultimate reality without misconception and without superimposing the subject-object duality as substantially different entities. This realization of reality is understood as the realization of suchness in terms of consciousness-only.
Furthermore, since external forms do not exist, mind and mental factors are also understood to be merely dependently arising phenomena without external forms or objects. Therefore, this is called realizing the true nature of reality as mind-only (consciousness-only).
How does this bodhisattva realize such suchness? Because this bodhisattva, through reasoning that will explain how forms and other phenomena arise from the ripening of internal predispositions, does not see in the mind any apprehended objects that are substantially different from itself, nor any apprehender that is separate from that. Having thoroughly realized that the three realms of existence are mere consciousness, they then familiarize themselves with the suchness that is empty of duality for a long time. Through this familiarization, they directly perceive through self-awareness just the essence that is empty of duality - an entity that is inexpressible in words as suchness. Therefore, through this sequence of prior familiarization, the sixth-ground bodhisattva realizes the suchness of mere consciousness.
If these are merely consciousness without external objects, then how does mind-only with such aspects arise here without external objects? The response is: Just as, for example, when the great ocean, which serves as the basis for waves, is stirred by wind and completely agitated, the waves of water, which were previously motionless like being asleep, are understood to flow everywhere by obtaining their own form through rising up; similarly, from the all-ground consciousness (ālayavijñāna) which contains the seeds of all external and internal phenomena, when attachment and faith and so forth cease, the ripening of habitual tendencies (vāsanās) placed in the all-ground that are in accordance with their own potentials produces mere impure dependent consciousness. It is precisely this that childish beings conceptualize as grasping and grasped objects separated as external and internal, but there is not even the slightest existence of a grasped object that is substantially different from consciousness.
This is like how those who assert Ishvara and others as causes say: "Just as the moon is the cause of moonstone, crystal is like water, and tree branches are like leaves, that [Ishvara] is the cause of all embodied beings." Similarly, those who assert the existence of alaya-consciousness also claim it to be the repository of all seeds by virtue of being the basis for all objects that consciousness perceives.
This is the distinction: while Ishvara (the Lord) is permanent, the alaya-vijnana (store consciousness) is impermanent. Therefore, those who have become habituated to non-Buddhist views through many lifetimes are to be tamed through the teaching of alaya-vijnana.
Now, when explaining the Cittamatra view in the commentary, it frequently states "there is no external reality" and "there is not even the slightest apprehended object that is separate from consciousness." When discussing the absence of form and other apprehended objects, it specifically mentions "separate from consciousness," and in the commentary on "understanding what is called the physical sense faculty of the eye," it states "there is no eye faculty that is separate from consciousness." Should we maintain this qualification of what is being negated in the Cittamatra context, as shown before? Or should we accept the non-existence of the five forms and five physical sense faculties without such qualification?$$Although this commentary contains both qualified and unqualified statements, just as when refuting production, where qualifications of what is being negated appear frequently and this qualification is carried over to all instances where it isn't explicitly stated, we should do the same here. In the source text presenting the opponent's position in the Mahāyānasaṃgraha, it states: "Why is it called appropriating consciousness? Because it is the cause of all physical sense faculties and serves as the basis for appropriating all bodies. Thus, as long as life continues, it maintains the five physical sense faculties without deterioration." And: "The common is the seed of the container world. The uncommon is the seed of individual sense fields. What is common is the seed that gives rise to the non-sentient." The Mahāyānasaṃgraha explains the seeds in the ālaya-consciousness for the container world as seeds for non-sentient entities. The Compendium (Samuccaya) explains similarly, and the Pratītyasamutpāda Commentary explains that name-and-form arise from the conditions of the ālaya-consciousness, where "name" refers to the other four aggregates and "form" refers to the elements and derived form. It explains that while such form doesn't exist in the formless realm, it does exist in the other two realms. Thus, there are countless instances in the Cittamatra system that accept the existence of form.$$If this were not the case, then in the Cittamatra context, regarding the form aggregate, all conventional designations such as form and sound would become completely unsuitable as conventions without any new interpretation. No Buddhist scholar in India would consider a philosophical system that renders conventional designations completely unusable to be valid.
The meaning of the term "proponents of cognizable objects as internal" is as follows: While cognizable objects are forms, sounds, and so forth, [this view] does not accept them as external, but rather asserts them to be internal phenomena of consciousness.
If the Cittamātra (Mind-Only school) accepts forms, sounds, and so forth, then their refutation of these being external objects becomes merely a dispute about terminology, because these very forms and so forth that appear as external objects are what is established as external objects.$$This is similar to saying that the dispute about existence or non-existence between this [Cittamātra view] and the Madhyamaka view (which refutes forms and such as being established by their own characteristics while still positing forms) is merely a terminological dispute, because these very forms and such that appear to be established by their own characteristics are what is established as having their own characteristics.$$This appears to be a major difficult point for both philosophical systems, because not only is the Madhyamaka way difficult, but in this Cittamātra system as well, if external objects are refuted, forms and such would become non-existent, and if forms and such are posited, external objects would also need to be posited. Although these matters are difficult, I have not written more for fear of being too verbose.
Because the scriptural exposition is known to be as previously explained, therefore the nature of dependent phenomena that is inherently established must necessarily be accepted. This is because it is asserted to be the basis and cause for all conceptual networks, such as the grasping at subject and object as imputed existents and as substantially different entities.
A mistaken perception of a rope as a snake cannot arise where there is no rope as a basis.
Just as illusions based on causes such as vases do not arise in empty space where there is no earth and other elements, if external objects did not exist, what kind of basis would there be for the conceptual misconception that appears as external blue and other colors? Therefore, one must necessarily accept the impure dependent nature that appears as subject and object as two separate substances, which is the cause of conceptual misconception appearing as external. This is because that very basis of appearance is the cause of both bondage and liberation in terms of defilement and purification.
According to both Madhyamaka and Cittamatra traditions, when phenomena appear to sentient beings and they grasp at these appearances as truly existent, if one can demonstrate that the object of this grasping is empty of the way it is conceived, then understanding such emptiness becomes the path. However, if instead of using emptiness to refute the objects that ordinary beings naturally grasp as truly existent, one tries to establish some other kind of emptiness as truly existent, this will not serve as an antidote to either subtle or coarse forms of grasping at true existence that have existed since beginningless time. Therefore, such effort is fruitless.
Thus, when one correctly sees that the dependent nature, which appears as duality, is empty of the imagined nature - the object of conceptual grasping that takes the appearance of subject and object as substantially different entities to exist as it appears - and when one perfectly understands that whatever remains here as the basis of emptiness and emptiness itself truly exists, then one will also properly grasp the meaning of emptiness.
Here, regarding the earlier position taken, as explained in the commentaries on the Bodhisattvabhūmi and Madhyāntavibhāga, the meaning of "where something is absent" and so forth was explained as before. However, in the commentary on the Uttaratantra, the explanation of the meaning of "whatever is absent in whatever" and so forth is completely different from the previous two, as it follows the Madhyamaka style of commentary. Due to fear of being too lengthy, I have not written it out.
That dependent nature arises solely from one's own latent imprints/habitual tendencies, without external objects to be grasped.
That which exists inherently and, according to this system, is ultimately beyond all conceptual elaborations and verbal expressions - having a nature that is not an object of any [conventional designations] - exists [in this way] because both external and internal expressions grasp appearances without direct analysis.
In brief, dependent nature (gzhan dbang) has three distinguishing characteristics: it arises without external objects, it exists by its own nature, and ultimately it is not an object of conceptual elaborations.
Since the causes that can be analyzed are subsumed within inherently existent things, they are not different from those three characteristics.
The statement "dependent nature exists" does not merely mean it exists, but rather indicates a specific kind of existence. As Master Sthiramati stated: "False imagination exists," where the phrase "by its own nature" is implied (literally: is the remainder of the phrase). Understanding this distinction is very important for what follows below.
Second, there are two parts: an extensive refutation and a conclusion of that refutation. The first has three parts: refuting the example of consciousness being inherently established without external objects, refuting the meaning of consciousness arising empty of objects from the power of habitual tendencies, and showing there is no contradiction between this refutation and meditation on unattractiveness. The first has two parts: refuting the dream example and refuting the example of seeing floating hairs. The first has three parts: showing that the dream example does not prove consciousness exists inherently, showing that the dream example does not prove there are no external objects when awake, and showing that the dream example proves all things are false. First, Mind-Only proponents, if you assert that external objects do not exist but consciousness established by its own characteristics does exist, then where is there an example like this? This itself should be examined.
The Mind-Only School says: For example, when sleeping in a very small room and dreaming of a herd of wild elephants, those elephants cannot possibly exist in that room. Therefore, just as in dreams where external objects don't exist, one must definitely accept that consciousness is inherently established. To this argument, to show that it lacks essence, it is explained: That very example should be examined and analyzed here.
What is to be analyzed further? Just as in a dream, when there appears a mind with the aspect of a herd of intoxicated cattle, that [mind] is not established by its own characteristics - according to my system, just as there is no [real] elephant as the object, because it is unborn.
If consciousness is not established by its own characteristics, then at that time, there is no example that is established for both [subject and object]. Therefore, consciousness cannot exist without external objects.
Here, just as an elephant appearing in a dream does not exist, this is not teaching that consciousness as a subject is non-existent, but rather it must definitely be understood as teaching that inherently established consciousness does not exist. As previously explained, when Mind-Only school accepts dependent nature without external objects, it is because dependent nature is inherently established. These refutations conclude that, in brief, "Just as objects of knowledge do not exist, consciousness also does not exist." The commentary clearly states that consciousness which appears as objects of knowledge should be understood as not arising through its own nature.
Furthermore, when refuting such types [of views] in both root texts and commentaries, since there are many qualifications applied to what is being negated, and since it is also stated by the great master: "Why is it said that consciousness arises from karma which arises from ignorance?" And since it is also our own tradition's position that ignorance produces karmic formations and karmic formations produce consciousness, there is no room for doubt among the wise regarding those who claim that this system denies consciousness altogether. Therefore, all parallel treatments of existence and non-existence regarding objects of knowledge and consciousness should be understood in terms of the specific qualifications of what is being negated.
If there is no delusion of consciousness in dreams, then one might think that upon waking, one would not later remember the experiences from the time of dreaming. This objection stems from thinking that if consciousness is not established by its own inherent nature, then consciousness does not exist at all.
This argument is not valid. If the mind of dreams inherently exists merely because one remembers dream experiences upon waking, then the external objects appearing in dreams, such as elephants, would also have to exist in the same way. Why? Just as you claim that the mind exists because there is memory when awake thinking "I saw this during the dream," similarly, since there is memory of experiencing objects thinking "I saw this object during the dream," either the external objects must also exist, or we must accept that consciousness also does not exist.
If one asks how to reconcile the existence and non-existence of dream objects and subjects in our tradition, since memory of both exists, here's the explanation: The commentary explains both the memory of dream experience and the memory of experiencing dream objects. When objects like elephants appear during dreams, it's similar to seeing a reflection in a mirror - just as the visual consciousness seeing the reflection doesn't actually experience the face itself, but does experience the reflection-dependent object, similarly during dreams, while there's no direct experience of the elephant, there is experience of the appearing object. Thus, while we speak of remembering the object, what we're actually remembering is the experience of that object.
Except in certain cases, distinguishing individual experiences of objects is not necessary for many such instances. Therefore, it is impossible to establish a dependent nature that is empty of external objects as existing by its own characteristics. Not only is there no direct example possible, but also like in proving the existence of past and future lives where there is no direct example, there isn't even an example of an alternative logical formulation that could prove it. Thus, one should understand that the refutation of the Mind-Only school is based on extremely powerful reasoning.
Secondly, if forms such as elephants exist in dreams, then the visual consciousness perceiving them would also have to exist in dreams, but this is not reasonable. When one is asleep, being disturbed by sleep, visual consciousness or awareness is impossible. Therefore, forms like elephants cannot be objects grasped by the visual sense faculty. Only mental consciousness exists. Thus, there are definitely no external visual sense objects, and when mental consciousness merely appears with the aspects of external objects, the attachment to them as being truly external arises inevitably.
If one claims that just as in dreams consciousness arises without external objects, similarly this should be accepted in the waking state - even if the previous example is not established, they think that through the dream example, consciousness without external objects is established in the waking state. This is not correct because it is impossible for mental consciousness to arise inherently in dreams. This means that even if we accept there are no visual sense fields in dreams, inherently existing mental consciousness without those [visual fields] is impossible even in dreams. Therefore, the combination of absence of external objects and inherently existing mental consciousness cannot serve as a valid example.
Just as according to your view, external objects do not truly arise in dreams, similarly, mental consciousness also does not arise inherently. Therefore, just as when awake and seeing forms, there is a coming together of three factors - the eye, form, and mind - likewise in dreams too, when perceiving objects, the mind apprehends the coming together of these three factors.
Just as in a dream there is neither eye nor visible form as its object, similarly, the visual consciousness produced by these two also does not exist. Therefore, all three - the dream eye, form, and mind - are false.
Similarly, the remaining three of the three [senses] of the ear and so forth, beyond the three of the eye, also do not arise inherently.
Here, the term "and so forth" includes from sound and ear consciousness up to mental faculty, mental objects (dharmas), and mental consciousness. As explained, the four sense faculties from ear faculty to body faculty, the four sense objects from sound to tactile objects, and the four consciousnesses starting with ear consciousness - just as explained earlier regarding the three elements of eye - are false because although they don't exist in dreams, they appear as their aspects. The three mental elements, though present in dreams, are false because they appear while lacking inherent existence.$$Therefore, those who assert that sense consciousness exists in dreams according to this master's system and then try to refute it are extremely crude in their intellectual approach. It's like what is said about "the sun of refutation rising before the dawn of understanding the opponent's position." This should be completely rejected. Regarding some who pride themselves as Tibetan scholars: without understanding even the basic systems of these great bodhisattva masters who are authorities on such philosophical tenets, they take them as objects of constant non-virtue and seem to lead many beings toward non-virtue. Be careful about this!
Here, regarding establishing our own position as explained by the Mind-Only school starting with "if in dreams...", when Master Bhāvaviveka also responded about the example not being established, he stated: "In dreams, there exists form that is included in the dharma-āyatana (mental objects) which is to be apprehended by mental consciousness. Therefore, consciousness never exists without an object." $$In response to this, that too is not logical because the three (object, sense faculty, and consciousness) as inherently established are impossible in all aspects during dreams. If one accepts this position just to refute another's system, then the dream example becomes meaningless, because since it would not be false, it would be impossible to demonstrate through this example that actual objects are false.$$The meaning of this statement is that the three - objects, sense faculties, and consciousness - as inherently established are impossible in all aspects even in dreams.
It should be explained that it is not reasonable for there to be something other than consciousness of form in the dharma-āyatana existing in dreams. At that time, one must also accept that form itself exists, and it is not contradictory for it to exist in dreams as well. Since it is clear that Bhāvaviveka accepts that form is established by its own characteristics, this should be used as the reason for its non-existence.
If, according to the Cittamatra (Mind-Only) system which denies external physical objects as separate entities, the dream example can refute [that position], and if in order to counter that refutation, one accepts that form exists through its own characteristics, then at that point, the Madhyamika's use of the dream example to prove the absence of inherent existence would become meaningless.
Dreams are not meaningless/false but have significance. Since they are established by their own characteristics, they arise as examples. It is impossible to establish the actual meaning they represent as false, because until self-existence is negated, there is no pervasion of the sign, property and example that proves the absence of true existence. Therefore, the previous response given in our own tradition - that everything appearing in dreams lacks inherent existence - was most excellent.
If asked whether according to our own tradition we accept or reject that clearly appearing forms in dreams are forms belonging to the mental sphere (dharma-āyatana), [we respond]: Since there are no sense consciousnesses in dreams, all appearances of the five objects appear only to mental consciousness. Therefore, although we cannot establish the five sense spheres like the visual sphere and so forth, just as a skeleton appearing clearly to mental consciousness alone is classified as belonging to the mental sphere, similarly [dream forms] are forms belonging to the mental sphere. Moreover, among the five types of forms in that [mental sphere], these are imagined forms. Through this [explanation], many similar cases should be understood.
Third: Because all three - the objects, sense faculties, and consciousness that appear in dreams - are unreal, therefore, by definitively establishing that dreams lack true existence, in order to prove that other phenomena which have not been established as lacking true existence also lack true existence, it is explained that even when awake, all phenomena will be proven to be without inherent nature.
Just as dream objects, sense faculties, and consciousness are false, likewise in this waking state too, all phenomena are false. Therefore, mind does not exist inherently, and similarly, the objects of sense faculties such as form and so forth do not exist, and the sense faculties themselves do not arise inherently. Thus, as stated in the sutra:$$"Just as illusory beings appear but are not real,$Though appearing, they are not truly existent.$Like illusions and dreams,$Thus are the dharmas taught by the Well-Gone One."$$And:$"The beings of existence are like dreams,$In this, there is no birth and no one dies.$No beings, persons, or life-force can be found,$These dharmas are like foam or water trees."$$This and other such teachings are well explained.
"No one is born" and so forth should be applied as stated in "In ultimate reality, it is not true," which qualifies what is to be negated. Those sutras, using the example of dreams, explain that all phenomena are not truly established in ultimate reality - this fits with Madhyamaka but does not fit with Cittamatra (Mind-Only school). Therefore, it is said this will be well explained.
Therefore, just as in this world, although there is the sleep of ignorance, for some who are awake and free from ordinary sleep distinct from that (ignorance), even though not inherently existent, in the perspective of what appears in dreams due to the sleep of ignorance - all three (object, sense faculty, and consciousness) exist. Similarly, for those who have not awakened and are not free from sleep, as long as they remain in that state, from their perspective, all three - the object, sense faculty, and consciousness - also exist.
Just as when one awakens from sleep, all three dream aspects cease to exist, likewise for the Buddhas who have directly realized the dharmadhātu by completely eliminating and uprooting the sleep of ignorance, none of these three exist, and therefore there is no consciousness without external objects.
Furthermore, from the perspective of seeing things as they are, these three do not appear. And from the perspective of seeing the extent of phenomena, although there are no appearances due to the influence of one's own subject being corrupted by the latent tendencies of ignorance, those appearances that manifest due to the influence of other beings' corrupted consciousness are known by the Buddha through appearing to him by way of appearing to them.
Second: If one argues, "Because those with eye disorders perceive non-existent floating hairs and such, consciousness must exist inherently even without external objects," this too is incorrect.
Why is this so? When someone whose eye faculty is affected by floaters perceives hair-like strands through the power of those floaters, then from the perspective of that person's consciousness of seeing, both the visual consciousness and the appearance of hair-like strands - that is, the object appearing as strands - exist simultaneously.
From the perspective of clear vision - that is, seeing with eyes free of visual distortions - both the appearance of floating hairs and the consciousness perceiving them are false and unborn. This is because it is difficult to ascertain the existence of consciousness without even the mere appearance of an object. This must definitely be accepted as certain in this way.
This is not so. If someone with an eye disorder develops a naturally established cognition that perceives the appearance of falling hairs where there are no knowable falling hairs, then wherever that person with the eye disorder sees those falling hairs and directs their gaze, even those without the eye disorder would develop a cognition seeing falling hairs similar to those with the disorder. This is because both cases are equally without an actual object.
If consciousness were inherently established, then just as [the argument] that something arising from other would entail arising from all possible others, similarly, when there is an inherently established consciousness, it would be incorrect that those with eye disease see floating hairs while those without eye disease do not see them, given that the object (empty space) is equally without floating hairs. This is because that consciousness, being independent of the eye disease, would have the power to project [appearances] without any connection [to conditions].
Therefore, since someone without an eye disorder does not perceive falling hairs [where there are none], consciousness that is inherently established without external objects does not exist.
Second, there are three parts: Refuting that consciousness of apparent objects arises or does not arise solely from ripened and unripened latent tendencies; Refuting the further assertion of consciousness existing without external objects; and Showing there is no scriptural contradiction in refuting the Mind-Only system. The first has two parts: Presenting others' positions and refuting those positions. $$For the first: If the existence of objects like appearing hair strands were the cause of consciousness arising, then hair strands would appear even to those without eye disease, but this is not the case. Then what is it? The ripening and non-ripening of previously established latent tendencies of consciousness are the causes for consciousness arising or not arising. Therefore, only for those persons who have ripened latent tendencies established by previous consciousness with the aspect of hair will consciousness with the aspect of hair strands arise.
If one asks: For those who see objects without eye disease, since the latent potential (bagchags) of consciousness that appears as floating hairs has not ripened, therefore the consciousness perceiving floating hairs does not arise in those without eye disease - but it's not that this consciousness doesn't arise due to the absence of actual floating hairs as knowable objects.
Second, there are three [points]: Refuting inherently established power in the present, refuting inherently established power in the future, and refuting inherently established power in the past. First, if there were something called "power" that was inherently established, then at that time, whether that power ripens or not, consciousness may or may not arise. However, since such an inherently established power does not exist, this [position] is not established.
If one asks how it is not established: When examining this potentiality, does it become something connected with present consciousness, or something connected with past and future consciousness? Regarding this, first, there cannot possibly be an inherently established potentiality in that which has arisen, namely the present, and there is also no potentiality in the nature of the unborn future.
In this case, if one asserts that present consciousness has potentiality, both consciousness and potentiality would become simultaneous. At that time, regarding the two - potentiality and that which possesses potentiality - when we say "consciousness of potentiality" using the sixth case [genitive], then since these two cannot be separate entities, it is not logical for the consciousness of potentiality to exist as potentiality itself. If it did exist as such, the effect would have no cause other than itself, and when a sprout is produced, the seed would not disintegrate.
When there is a fifth case ending indicating "consciousness from potency" in relation to both potency and that which possesses potency, it is not logical for consciousness to arise from a potency that is simultaneous with the arising of consciousness. This is because the effect would exist at the same time as its cause. Therefore, for present consciousness, there cannot be its causal potency.
Secondly, if there is potential in unborn consciousness, when we apply the term "potential of consciousness," potential is the basis of qualification and consciousness is the qualifying property. In this case, unborn future consciousness cannot be demonstrated as having the nature of an established consciousness, nor can it be demonstrated as having the nature of an inherently established negation that is "not consciousness."
At the time when future consciousness does not exist as present consciousness, how can one distinguish and specify "this potential is the potential of this consciousness"? It cannot be done.
Therefore, without the distinguishing consciousness, there cannot be a capacity that is qualified by it. If this were not the case, it would absurdly follow that even a barren woman's son would possess such a capacity.
If a consciousness arises from potential, considering this in mind, one might say "this is the potential of this consciousness, and from this potential, this consciousness will arise." Thus it becomes a matter of qualifier and qualified, just as in the world when one says "cook the rice" or "weave cloth from this thread," referring to the future rice and cloth. As stated in the Abhidharma: "There are three types of entering the womb: the universal monarch and the two self-arisen ones." Just as it explains the entering of the womb by those who will become universal monarchs and so forth, one might claim that the potential of consciousness refers to the consciousness that will arise.$$However, this is meaningless. If something exists occasionally, then that result would only arise at that time. But things that definitely never arise at any time, like the son of a barren woman or unconditioned space, will not arise either now or later. Therefore, even if there were an inherently existent potential, when the future consciousness that is inherently existent never exists at any time, then at that time, like the son of a barren woman, there can be no arising of an inherently existent consciousness without the potential to produce an inherently existent consciousness.
When Madhyamikas refute the inherent existence of sprouts in many contexts, they often present the following absurd consequence: "If a sprout that doesn't exist at the time of its seed can still arise, then rabbit horns and such should also arise." The key point of this reductio ad absurdum argument is that if a sprout were inherently existent, then when it doesn't exist at one point, it must never exist at all, making it equivalent to something utterly non-existent. This is not meant to generally refute that something which doesn't exist at the time of its cause can arise. Otherwise, rabbit horns would arise too. This reasoning also applies to cooked rice and similar things, because if things arose inherently, then future cooked rice and such would have to be completely non-existent.
Furthermore, the potential is established in dependence upon the future arising of consciousness, and if consciousness is established in dependence upon that potential, saying "consciousness arises from potential," then they would be established through mutual dependence. If one accepts this, then the noble ones endowed with supreme wisdom declare that consciousness itself is not inherently established.
In the commentary, relative phenomena such as long and short, far and near, are said to exist as mere designations, but not as inherently established. Therefore, one should understand that this is not a general refutation of existence, but rather specifically refutes inherent existence. If one speaks in this way, they will follow our way of speaking. Thus, consciousness has no power over future events.
Third, to show that there is no power even in the past, it is explained: If consciousness, which ceases after arising, places a special potency of imprints in the alaya-consciousness for the purpose of producing its corresponding result, and if future consciousness arises from the ripening of the power of ceased consciousness, then from the power of an inherently established 'other,' another resultant consciousness would arise. Why? Because according to your view, in the sequential arising of momentary continua, there exists an inherent difference between earlier and later moments.
Furthermore, from the root word 'gyun' (continuous), when the suffix 'ta nu' is added according to the rule "ta nu refers to expansion," it becomes 'gyun' (continuity). Like the continuous flow of a river, when cause and effect are connected in an unbroken continuum, it refers to the conditioned phenomena of the three times that are uninterrupted by empty spaces in the succession of birth and death. These momentary instances are parts of a whole, not merely an uninterrupted sequence of before, middle, and after. Since the substantial momentary parts exist within the continuum, the substantial momentary components are called 'possessors of continuity.' Because the parts and components belong to that whole continuum, the continuum is referred to as their 'close appropriator,' just as a pot is the close appropriator of its parts like the spout and neck.
Those earlier and later moments are mutually distinct and different from each other, and the opponent accepts them as being inherently different by their own characteristics. Thus, it would follow that one thing arises from the power of another that is inherently established.
If one thinks "That is not a fault because it is desired," then consequently all things would arise from all other things different from themselves.
Although there are sequential moments of before and after where the momentary substances with continuity are inherently established as different or separate from each other, nevertheless, for those sequential moments of before and after, there is no difference in their continuum - it is precisely one [continuum]. Therefore, there is no fault of everything arising from everything else. If one responds thus, this [idea] that the earlier and later [moments] are of one continuum is the main response to avoid the extreme consequence in terms of production from other.
If a single continuum is established for inherently distinct earlier and later instances, even if we accept this without fault, this single continuum itself is not established and therefore needs to be proven. Why? Because for things that are inherently established as separate in terms of earlier and later instances, it is not logical to have an undifferentiated continuum or single stream. For example, just as what belongs to or is included in the continua of Maitreya and Upali are different individual persons and therefore cannot belong to a single continuum, similarly, whatever earlier and later instances that are established by their own characteristics as separate cannot reasonably belong to or be included in a single continuum. Thus, this addresses the fault of an overly broad consequence regarding production from other.
While rice sprouts are of one continuum and barley sprouts are of a different continuum, saying "everything does not arise from everything" cannot avoid the fault. The opponent's key point of being unable to avoid the fault lies in accepting inherently established otherness. This makes it very clear that it's not merely referring to otherness in general. Yet some push arguments about shared exclusions and such. Not understanding that the phrase "inherently established otherness" qualifies what is being negated, they fabricate reasons not stated by Chandrakirti himself for why he said the fault cannot be avoided. This undermines the correct philosophical view.
Second, there are two parts: stating others' positions and refuting those positions. First, having taught thus, the Mind-Only school, primarily expressing their own position, thought they could establish their desired meaning and said: When a consciousness other than the store consciousness (alayavijñana) ceases, it places in the store consciousness whatever latent potential that is one's own capacity to produce visual consciousness or awareness. Later, when that ripens, visual consciousness arises following the pattern of that previous [consciousness].
That which serves as the basis for one's own eye consciousness - the uninterrupted momentary potential from which it arises - is what confused worldly beings mistakenly understand to be the physical sense faculty of the eye. However, there is no eye faculty that exists separately from consciousness. Similarly, this should be applied to the remaining physical sense faculties as well.
In this regard, the latent habitual tendencies (vasanas) that cause visual consciousness to arise are its causal conditions, while the eye faculty is the dominant condition for visual consciousness.
When it is taught here that the eye faculty is the direct cause of eye consciousness, this refers to the occasion when the latent predispositions for eye consciousness ripen, rather than referring to whatever constitutes the eye faculty itself.
Furthermore, from the Madhyāntavibhāga: "Consciousness arises as appearances of objects and beings, but those objects do not exist." This explains that consciousness arises as appearances of objects like forms and as the five sense faculties of beings. This refers to the alaya-vijñāna (foundation consciousness). As Master Sthiramati also explained that the physical sense faculties are objects of the alaya-vijñāna, the Cittamātra (Mind-Only) proponents who accept alaya-vijñāna assert that the physical sense faculties appearing in the alaya-vijñāna manifest as eye faculty and so forth.
Having shown that there are no sense organs like the eye faculty separate from consciousness, in order to show that form also does not exist as a separate entity from consciousness, it is said: In this world, the five types of cognition arising from the five sense faculties appear as blue and other external objects without actually having external referents. These appearances arise from the ripening of seeds stored in the foundational consciousness (alaya-vijnana). Not realizing this, ordinary beings grasp and become attached to the mind's appearances of blue and other [colors] as if they were external objects.
